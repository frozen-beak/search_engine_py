the ac schnitzer special equipment for the bmw i8 emphasises even more clearly the sporting performance and innovative design of the powerful, environmentally-friendly coupe. lowered by 25 mm at the front and 20 mm at the rear, the i8 by ac schnitzer hugs the tarmac more closely than the standard vehicle and can therefore develop maximum efficiency and dynamics on the road. ac schnitzer carbon front spoiler elements, carbon side skirts (left and right) and a carbon rear wing also ensure that the driving pleasure can be fully enjoyed on acceleration from both the powerful petrol engine and from the electric motor.
the tuning specialists also have something up their sleeve for the wheel set of the bmw i8: the new ac1 forged alloys from ac schnitzer are perfectly designed for the sports car, combining the hybrid look with a sporting design. with corresponding tyres and in bicolor, the new generation of wheels from aachen perfectly suits the innovative plug-in hybrid from munich – especially as it is available in any colour you want. with the ac1 wheel, ac schnitzer has reinterpreted the classic double-spoke design. with sophisticated style, the spokes form triangle tips towards the rim which widen into the wheel centre forming five trapezoids. these guide the eye straight to the single classic element of the ac1 rim: the 5-cornered hub cap with the ac schnitzer logo.
