the huracán super trofeo marks a new benchmark for the race series. according to maurizio reggiani, in charge of lamborghini’s research and development department and motorsport activities, “the huracán lp620-2 super trofeo is an all-new car built from scratch with a clear racing concept. every feature is engineered for sophisticated high performance, complying with the strictest motorsport safety standards.”
the chassis features an exceptionally light roll cage at just 43 kg that extends to the rear axle, and impressive torsional stiffness that represents a massive 45% improvement compared to the previous model. the frame is a hybrid carbon/aluminum construction with modified geometries to house an improved radiator up front and better accommodate the racing gearbox at the rear, which also provides better aerodynamics. the dry weight of the huracán super trofeo is 1,270 kg, with a weight distribution of 42/58%.
the bodywork is in composite materials and, along with the aerodynamics, has been developed in collaboration with dallara engineering with the direct involvement of the founder gian paolo dallara. refinements to the huracán super trofeo include new bodywork ‘fast fittings’, and a new oil radiator providing even more performance than that found on the gallardo.
