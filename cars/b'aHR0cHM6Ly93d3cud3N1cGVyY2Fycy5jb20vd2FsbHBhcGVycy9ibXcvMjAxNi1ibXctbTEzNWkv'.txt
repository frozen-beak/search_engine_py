an extensively modified front- and rear-end design, a sophisticated premium ambience when you step inside and fresh reserves of power under the bonnet are all part of the even more expressive, sporting and efficiency-focused skillset of the new bmw 1-series model range. almost two million units of the bmw 1-series have been sold worldwide over the last ten years, and this latest edition is poised to set another new benchmark in driving pleasure in the premium compact segment. the new 3-door and 5-door bmw 1-series models come with a comprehensively revised engine line-up and additional measures designed to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, allowing them to lead the way once again in the introduction of new bmw efficientdynamics technology.
the selection of engines available for the new bmw 1-series model range has been enhanced by the addition of latest-generation petrol and diesel units with three and four cylinders. the torquey and high-revving engines with bmw twinpower turbo technology team up with rear-wheel drive – still a unique selling point in the compact segment – to deliver a suitably intense driving experience. and an even broader spread of standard equipment, an output boost for the six-cylinder in-line engine powering the bmw m135i m performance automobile and cutting-edge innovations from bmw connecteddrive also imbue the brand’s hallmark characteristics with renewed vigour.
