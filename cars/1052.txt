the bmw group has chosen 2015 auto guangzhou, one of the largest international motor shows in china, to present a very special new development to the global public: the company’s vision of a four-door sedan for the compact segment. “the bmw compact sedan concept reveals the potential we see in a compact sedan,” says adrian van hooydonk, senior vice president bmw group design. “it not only gives the driver and passengers generous amounts of space within a compact area but does so while providing the sporting ability you’d expect from bmw and an elegance otherwise only available in large bmw sedans. the quality and intrinsic value of the bmw compact sedan concept are clear signals of our premium intentions for the car.”
the compact and agile exterior of the bmw compact sedan concept creates a familiar sedan silhouette based around a striking three-box design. hallmark bmw proportions imbue the car with a dynamic allure unrivalled in its segment. its sweeping bonnet and long wheelbase stretch the car visually, while the slightly set-back greenhouse further underlines its sporting nature. the clever use of time-honoured bmw elements, such as a  long, prominent swage line, dynamic hofmeister kink and surfaces moulded with impressive depth, ensures the car cuts an athletic figure from the side and highlights its relationship with other bmw vehicles. the four doors are integrated harmoniously into its proportions and allow easy entry for the driver and all passengers. discreet soft-touch handles below the swage line open the doors as soon as a finger touches their metal surface.
