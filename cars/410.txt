the goldilocks 911 is back, as porches launches the carrera gts that hits the sweet spot of driving dynamics and price. the formula for the gts is to take the 911 carrera and fit it with a selection of goodies from the higher spec gt3 and turbo 911’s. not only does this create a better performing and handling sports car, but it bridges the gap to the aforementioned top of the line models.
the 911 carrera gts models will include a host of options including all-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive, manual transmission or pdk, coupe, convertible and targa body styles and finally a lightweight package, which removes 25kg from the kerb weight.
standard equipment includes a pasm sport chassis, recalibrated dampers, 10mm lower ride height, new anti-roll bars, stiffer springs with helper springs on the rear axle and bigger brakes. the gts also gets a more powerful engine with a 3.0l flat 6 turbocharged unit that delivers 473 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque.
