bmw’s first ever fully electric 7-series has arrived, ready to take on the mercedes eqs. using an identical skin to the 7-series, the i7 has the same chassis which has been designed to accommodate the large 101.7 kwh battery pack in the floor. bmw have been able to achieve a balance between electric and gasoline engine layout requirements, enabling both to work without much compromise.
utilising a pair of electric motors on each axle, the i7 has a peak power figure of 536 hp, which matches that of the v8 powered 7-series exactly. peak torque is also impressive topping out at 549 lb-ft, only 4 lb-ft less than the v8. the wltp range is rated at between 367 and 388 miles and charging goes up to 195 kw dc that will provide 80 miles of range in 10 minutes. bmw have stated that a performance version of the i7, likely called the m70 will arrive in the near future with around 650 hp on tap.
