the new skyline coupe builds on the strengths and attributes of the current skyline sedan – attraction, sophistication and high-performance – and takes them to an even higher level. it combines dramatic styling and a refined, driver-oriented interior with the advanced performance made possible by a newly developed, innovative vvel (variable valve event and lift) 3.7-liter v6 engine and a high-performance platform to create a vehicle that will appeal the discerning coupe buyer.
the new skyline coupe’s seductive exterior design starts with its powerful, elegant front fender curvature, flowing silhouette and glamorous front and rear fenders. the expressive front fascia features characteristic skyline fender lines and a low, rhythmic, wave-like hood. the sculpted, bright-finished grille and l-shaped bi-xenon headlights add to its commanding presence. large wheel wells, skyline-signature led combination taillights and dual exhaust enhance the new skyline coupe’s high-performance appearance. a unique front bumper with matching side sill spoilers is available with skyline 370gt type sp and s models. seven exterior colors are offered, including nissan’s two new colors: vibrant red and luna mare silver.
