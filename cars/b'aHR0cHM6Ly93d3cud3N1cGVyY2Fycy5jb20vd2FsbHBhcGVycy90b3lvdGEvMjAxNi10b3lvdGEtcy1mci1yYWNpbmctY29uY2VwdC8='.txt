with its sporty yet simple design, the toyota s-fr turned heads when it made its global premiere at the 2015 tokyo motor show. now, toyota gazoo racing plans to reimagine the concept as a track-ready race car at 2016 tokyo auto salon.
with wide flared fenders, eye-catching hood vents, and use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic canards and front/rear spoilers, this concept represents toyota’s vision of the s-fr as a performance vehicle born for the racing circuit. while the model displayed at the 2015 tokyo motor show had simple, familiar styling, the toyota s-fr racing concept aims for a more aggressive look.
