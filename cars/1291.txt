the stage is set for the new mercedes-benz sl63 amg. the new version of the high-performance roadster impresses on several counts: systematic lightweight construction, a boost in output and driving dynamics, and 30 percent lower fuel consumption and emissions. thanks to an all-aluminium bodyshell, similar to that of the sls amg super sports car, the vehicle weight has been reduced by 125 kilograms. with a kerb weight of 1845 kilograms and an output of 395 kw / 537 hp or 415 kw / 564 hp, the new model has the perfect recipe for unparalleled dynamism and a superior driving experience. a further boost in performance comes courtesy of a winning combination: enhanced amg sports suspension based on active body control (abc), new amg speed-sensitive sports steering, the amg high-performance compound brake system and the amg speedshift mct 7-speed sports transmission. an enticing mix of stylish design, extensive standard equipment and a high safety level.
ola källenius, ceo at mercedes-amg gmbh: “the new sl63 amg is yet another masterpiece from mercedes-amg. be it driving dynamics, lightweight construction or efficiency – the sl63 amg represents a giant leap forward. following on from the sls amg roadster and the slk55 amg, it now makes our unrivalled roadster family practically complete.”
