mercedes-benz presented a superlative dream car in the guise of the s63 cabriolet. for the first time in its 48-year history, mercedes‑benz’s sports car and high-performance brand is offering a four-seater cabriolet in the s-class segment, adding to its product portfolio an attractive alternative for automobile enthusiasts with a penchant for performance and luxury. the new model also offers its driver and up to three passengers space to travel in style. its high-calibre statistics: 5.5-litre v8 biturbo engine with an output of 430 kw / 585 hp and peak torque of 900 nm, amg performance 4matic all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard, acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds and a high-performance composite brake system for optimum deceleration.
the basis for the vehicle’s superior and dynamic character is provided by the particularly rigid bodyshell structure featuring innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of magnesium. the increase in weight which is inherent to the design of a convertible has been limited by the use of a lightweight lithium-ion battery, amg light-alloy wheels produced by means of a sophisticated forging process and the weight-optimised amg high-performance composite brake system. in addition, large parts of the shell and the front section are made of aluminium, as is the vehicle’s rear end.
