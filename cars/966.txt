bmw presented the racing version of the new bmw m3 at the 2008 chicago auto show. powered by a 485 bhp eight cylinder engine, this impressive race car has been designed to compete in the american le mans series (alms) beginning in 2009. the car is based on the fourth generation of the bmw m3, the high-performance sports car produced by bmw m gmbh.
bmw motorsport director mario theissen says: “with the sporting genes of the production bmw m3 being clearly evident, developing a racing version of the car was the next logical step. the fact that the road-going vehicle is fitted with a v8 engine as standard provided us with an ideal base. however, the bmw m3 is more than a race car, it has achieved legendary status amongst race fans across the globe. i am convinced that this unique story of the bmw m3 racing cars will now be expanded upon by the addition of further chapters.”
