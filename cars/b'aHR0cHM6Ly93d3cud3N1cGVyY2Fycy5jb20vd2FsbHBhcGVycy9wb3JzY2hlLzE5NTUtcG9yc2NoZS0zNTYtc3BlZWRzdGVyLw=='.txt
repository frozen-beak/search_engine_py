created as the cheaper, minimalist cabriolet to take on the roadsters of the time, the porsche 356 speedster was a great success. the cut-down curved windshield and lack of folding roof didnâ€™t stop people from snapping up the speedster which also enjoyed fame on the racing circuit amongst amateur racing drivers.
whilst the 356 is one of the most beautiful porsche ever built, the speedster version always had that something extra special about it, like it was always meant to have the roof removed. the paired back nature combined with good looks and a more engaging driving experience helped to make the 356 speedster a highly desirable porsche for collectors to this day.
