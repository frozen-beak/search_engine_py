porsches homologation special 911 rs 2.7 is considered one of, if not the best 911’s ever made. it was the fastest production 911 of it’s era and featured flared wheel arches, a big ducktail rear spoiler, reduced weight and iconic ‘carrera’ stickers along the bottom of the doors.
built on top of the 911s 2.4, the rs 2.7 utilised knowledge gained from the 917 racing program, enlarging the flat 6 engine to 2.7l and reducing the weight to as little as 975 kg. the bigger engine resulted in not only power rising from 193 to 210 hp, but a stronger, flatter torque curve. the weight loss program included thinner glass and a stripped interior, fiberglass bumpers and gauge steel for the fenders, hood and roof.
