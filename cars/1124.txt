a new contender for the hot hatch crown has arrived, packing 415 horsepower and a 0-62 mph time of under 4 seconds the mercedes-amg a45 will be hard to beat. going head to head with the likes of the audi rs3, ford focus rs and volkswagen golf r, the new a45 amg has managed to top them all on the spec sheet. to achieve this feat, mercedes have developed an all new bespoke four-cylinder engine that is being built at amg engine works in affalterbach. called the m139, it features a new twin-scroll turbocharger, heavy-duty internals, extensive cooling, and cylinder linings derived from technology developed in f1.
the peak power output of 421 ps (310 kw) comes in at 6,750 rpm, and the 369 lb-ft (500 nm) of torque is available at a rather high 6,000 rpm. the transmission is an  eight-speed dual-clutch unit sending power to an all-wheel drive system with a torque vectoring rear differential. this diff is able to send power to either of the rear wheels in order to adjust the cornering attitude of the car depending on the driver mode selected.
