mercedes have taken the wraps off their new ultra luxury maybach sl monogram. this represents the first time a maybach model has been made from a car developed by amg, with all previous efforts built on mercedes made cars. this has resulted in a slightly sportier offering than usual that maybach had to tone down to get the same ease and nearly floating driving experience their buyers expect. visually, the sl monogram features a pattern of maybach monograms (hence the name) plastered across the hood and fabric roof and even the lower front air intake grille. buyers will have a choice of two wheel designs with a multi-spoke option and a striking five-spoke forged monoblock design that brings plenty of bling factor.
