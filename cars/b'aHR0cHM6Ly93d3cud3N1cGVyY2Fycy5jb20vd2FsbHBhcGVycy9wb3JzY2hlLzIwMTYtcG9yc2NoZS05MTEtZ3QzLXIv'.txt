based on the 911 gt3 rs production sports car, porsche has designed a customer sport race car for gt3 series around the world: the 911 gt3 r. in developing the more than 368 kw / 500 hp racing nine-eleven, special attention was paid to lightweight design, better aerodynamic efficiency, reducing consumption, improved handling, further optimised safety as well as lowering service and spare parts costs.
adopted from its production sibling, the 911 gt3 r features the distinctive double-bubble roof, and the wheelbase which had been lengthened by 8.3 centimetres compared to the previous generation. this ensures a more balanced weight distribution and more predictable handling particularly in fast corners corners in comparison to the previous gt3 r. by applying systematic lightweight solutions for the body, add-on parts, and suspension, the engineers significantly optimised the centre of gravity position of the gt3 r compared to the predecessor model. the lightweight body design of the 911 gt3 rs production sports car featuring intelligent aluminium-steel composite construction has proven to be the ideal basis for the race car. the roof, front cover and fairing, wheel arches, doors, side and tail sections as well as the rear cover are made of particularly light carbon-fibre composite material (cfrp). all windows – and for the first time even the windscreen – consist of polycarbonate.
