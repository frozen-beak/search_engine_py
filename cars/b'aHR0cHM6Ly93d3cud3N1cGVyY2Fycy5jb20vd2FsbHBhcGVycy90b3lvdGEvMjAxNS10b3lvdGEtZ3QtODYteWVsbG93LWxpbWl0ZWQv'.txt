another japan exclusive toyota gt86 has arrived in the form of the yellow edition. available in three different iterations the base yellow limited package, includes new detailing on the inside and outside, the yellow limited aero package adds a giant rear wing and new front bumper, and the yellow limited aero package ft includes some suspension upgrades to the mix.
the first change on the list is the bright yellow paint job called sunrise yellow, a colour that is sure to make your new gt86 stand out from the crowd. blacked out elements on the side mirrors, rear wing and front bumper also add to new visuals, with new 17-inch alloy wheels completing the look. 
if you were hoping for some more power being added, you we leave disappointed, with the subaru sourced boxer engine remaining the same as all other gt86 toyotas. the only mechanical changes come with the yellow limited aero ft package, and they are all focused on the suspension and handling of the car. sachs dampers replace the stock ones, the brake pads have been updated too, along with stickier bridgestone potenza s001 tires coming in at 215/40r18 up front and 225/40r18 at the back. these upgrades are minor in scope, but will still provide an improvement to the already capable handling characteristics of the gt86.
