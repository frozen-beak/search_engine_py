equipped with a v10 engine that produces more than 600 horsepower and with the most advanced, cutting-edge automotive technologies, the 2004 porsche carrera gt uses the undiluted qualities of a genuine racecar to provide an unprecedented driving experience on the road.  among the car’s unique features are its 5.7-liter, 605-horsepower v10 engine; its monocoque chassis with engine and transmission mounts made of carbon-reinforced plastic; and the first use of a ceramic composite clutch in a production car. its aerodynamic and race-bred suspension package provides safe and stable travel at speeds of up to 205 mph (330 km/h), and the carrera gt features a lot of lightweight materials, such as magnesium for the car’s huge wheels and special sport seats. 
the result of such artistic and athletic equipment is a car that accelerates from a standing start to 62 mph (100 km/h) in only 3.9 seconds, reaches 100 mph (160 km/h) in less than seven seconds, 125 mph (200 km/h) in less than 10 seconds, and can achieve a top test-track speed of 205 mph (330 km/h). the porsche carrera gt made its stunning yet fitting debut as a prototype car at the famed louvre art museum in paris in the fall of 2000. after undergoing development and testing, the final production version was unveiled at the 2003 geneva show. the porsche carrera gt will be built at porsche’s new plant in leipzig, germany, with deliveries beginning late in the 2003 calendar year.
