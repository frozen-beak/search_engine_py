the more affordable base model porsche 911 turbo is a car that is very fast, extremely capable and an outright supercar in it’s own right. the regular turbo sits between the mighty turbo s and carrera gts in the 992 series of porsche’s 911 product line-up. as is usually the case with these model line-up’s, the mechanicals of the turbo are very similar to the turbo s, just with a slightly toned down tune resulting in a little less power and performance.
we can see the differences through the power and torque outputs of both cars, with peak power reducing from 650 ps to 580 ps, a significant drop but it keeps the turbo in the range of remaining a very powerful car. peak torque has also dropped from 590 lb-ft to 553 lb-ft. acceleration as expected is a little slower from 0-62 mph, but only by 0.1 seconds, which is so close most would struggle to notice on the road. the same eight-speed dual-clutch pdk automatic transmission is used in both cars, delivering quick and reliable shifts in a manner which makes it one of the best transmissions around.
