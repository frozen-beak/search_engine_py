the r8 competition redefines the iconic r8 as the pinnacle of audi performance with 570 hp and racing-inspired, lightweight matte carbon elements. the high-performance r8 competition features a 570hp 5.2l v10 mated exclusively to a seven-speed s tronic and a sport exhaust system with black high-gloss tailpipes. this combination results in a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds and a top speed of 199 mph, making it the fastest r8 ever offered.
the r8 competition is engineered to push the limits, sharing the same naturally aspirated v10 fsi engine as the audi r8 lms race car which has won daytona and nuerburgring 24 hour races as well as all other major gt races around the globe. the award-winning gt-engine represents the pinnacle of durability, requiring its first major service after approximately 13,000 miles under race conditions or approximately one full race season. competitor engines require a major service after one 24 hour race.
further enhancing the unmistakable audi r8 competition design are striking matte carbon exterior elements consisting of a fixed rear spoiler, engine bay, mirror housings, flics, side blades, front spoiler and rear diffusor. the combination of the carbon elements lower the weight of the r8 competition and also provide greater downforce. gloss black wheels with 305 cross-section rear tires and ceramic brakes with anodized red brake calipers provide a stunning contrast to the matte carbon fiber elements. inside, drivers will find a matte carbon fiber treatment including the center console and illuminated “r8 competition” door sill inlays. the r8 competition is an audi exclusive line vehicle, which allows the driver to pair a variety of interior and exterior colors and choose from a selection of wheel finishes for a striking look designed to meet driver needs and tastes.
