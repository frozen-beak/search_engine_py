boasting a completely redeveloped drive, the porsche 911 gt3 cup will take to the starting line on the world’s race tracks from 2017. the rear of the world’s most-produced gt racing car now houses a 4-litre, six-cylinder flat engine for even more drive. thanks to thoroughbred motorsport technology, the compact engine with direct fuel injection delivers peak performance of 357 kw (485 hp).
a range of innovative details also improve efficiency in addition to engine performance, ensuring even better durability of the naturally aspirated engine in racing mode and reduced maintenance costs. a valve drive with rigidly mounted rocker arms and a central oil feed is being used for the very first time. what’s more, an integrated oil centrifuge is used to optimise oil defoaming in the engine. a crankshaft with significantly increased rigidity has also been installed.
a new front apron and a new rear end improve the downforce of the new porsche 911 911 gt3 cup and therefore enhance traction and performance. the prominent 184-centimetre wide rear wing has been retained from the predecessor model. the wheel dimensions are also unchanged: one-piece 18-inch racing rims with a central locking mechanism are used – with 270-millimetre michelin racing slicks on the front axle, and a massive 310-millimetre tread on the rear axle. the intelligent aluminium-steel composite construction ensures maximum rigidity and a lightweight body. the new 911 gt3 cup is ready to race weighing in at just 1200 kilograms.
