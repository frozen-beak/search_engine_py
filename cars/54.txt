with the new lamborghini gallardo lp 570-4 squadra corse, automobili lamborghini brings race track emotion directly to the road. it delivers high performance and brings the fascination of motor racing to the street-legal world. this new and most extreme model in the gallardo line-up is based on the gallardo super trofeo, the successful race car from the lamborghini blancpain super trofeo, the world’s fastest one-make series.
the name squadra corse refers to the recently-founded department within automobili lamborghini, which manages all motorsport activities from gt3 to the lamborghini blancpain super trofeo championships in europe, asia and america where gentlemen drivers battle face-to-face in fierce contests on the most challenging racetracks.
the new lamborghini gallardo squadra corse is very close to the race cars. both share the same v10 engine, which is used in the racing version with no modifications. likewise, the squadra corse has the same rear wing for greater aerodynamic load – achieving, under the best aerodynamic conditions, three times the load of the gallardo lp 560-4 – for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. another element taken directly from the racing version is the removable engine hood with quick-release system. both the rear wing and the hood are made from carbon composite material, as are a host of other components on the squadra corse.
