for the 993 generation of the porsche 911, the gt2 was basically a 911 turbo with the all-wheel drive removed in favour of a rear-wheel drive setup. this was done for motorsport purposes as all-wheel drive cars were increasingly limited or banned due in part to the earlier success of audis quattro cars, the nissan skyline and porsches own 961.
in order to qualify for racing, porsche had to make a limited number of street cars for homologation purposes. being such a rare car makes a 993 gt2 very desirable to any porsche fan. various versions of the gt2 were used for racing, all with different power setups including a 600 hp “evo” model designed for the gt1 racing series in 1996.
