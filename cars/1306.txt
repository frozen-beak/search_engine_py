mercedes-benz is reshaping the technology and design of its successful silver arrows. on occasion of the international auto show in detroit, the premium marque in the new daimlerchrysler group is presenting the study of a gran turismo for the 21st century which combines stylistic elements of the current formula 1 silver arrow and the slr sports car from the 1950s into a new fascinating concept. its name: vision slr.
the striking front section with the arrow-shaped nose and the typical double spoilers takes the formula 1 racing car with which mika h√§kkinen won the 1998 world championship as its model, a formal concept which is repeated variously on the body and in the interior. these formula 1 looks harmonize with the familiar double headlights of the typical mercedes four-eyed design which appears in the vision slr in a new, unusual interpretation.
the long and extended hood, the powerful sweep of the wings and the gull-wing doors of the vision slr are based on the stylistic ideas of the legendary sl models from the 1950s and their slr racing variants, in which juan manuel fangio, rudolf caracciola and stirling moss drove from one victory to the next.
with this successful transfer of racing car attributes to a roadworthy gran turismo, the vision slr displays ideas which will influence the appearance of future mercedes sports cars.
