following the global success of the exhilarating, entirely driver-oriented gt86, the toyota ft-86 open concept has been created to gauge customer reaction to the possible launch of a convertible version of toyota’s remarkable, front ‘boxer’ engined, rear-wheel drive, compact 2+2 sports car.
the toyota ft-86 open concept is designed to combine all the lively, accessible performance and highly engaging, readily exploitable dynamic abilities of the gt86 with the even greater levels of driving pleasure derived from open-topped motoring.
the concept vehicle retains the gt86’s 2+2 seating format, the roof being stowed behind fixed rear seats with minimal impact on luggage capacity. using an intense contrast between pure bright white and the modern navy blue, the colour combination has been designed to express the sense of elegant performance, fully reflecting the spirit and the atmosphere of milan, one of the world leaders in fashion design.
