joy of joys, the porsche 911 gt3 is available with a manual transmission again. despite being half a second slower to 100 kph (3.4 sec to 3.9 sec) when compared to the dual clutch pdk gearbox, many buyers will be very happy with the option to row your own gears again. at the heart of the car remains a high revving naturally aspirated flat 6 engine which remains virtually unchanged from the gt3 cup racing car.
visual changes are minor as always for a 911, though highlights include different front and rear fascias and carbon fibre aero elements. driving the gt2 should be even better than before with a reworked chassis & suspension setup for even better driving dynamics on the race track and road. dynamic engine mounts,  active rear-axle steering and the rear differential lock are also used to help boost the car’s driving dynamics.
