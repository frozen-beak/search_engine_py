meet the long-tail huayra, the limited edition codalunga, and the first creation from pagani’s new grandi complicazioni division. that division is essentially a special projects department that worked closely with a couple of clients who had long been requesting a long-tail pagani. only five vehicles will be made in total with a price tag starting at a steep €7 million.
after two years of development the codalunga was born of the le mans long tails from the sixties, which featured a simple linear style with clean lines. the front is very huayra with not much different, but the rear is a completely new design. as the name suggests the rear overhang is longer with the central quad exhaust tips and triple light lens setup still present. the rear quarter panels and buttresses feature a curved shape as the extended rear deck swoops down low past the engine before starting to rise again. the space created below the tail lights has remined open with no grille covering providing a view of the exhaust piping and actuating rear flap mechanism.
