bmw i stands for the creation of pure-bred vehicle concepts, sustainability throughout the value chain, complementary mobility services and a fresh understanding of premium defined squarely in terms of sustainability. and now the bmw group can unveil the bmw i8 – a new, cutting-edge generation of sports car. the second model unveiled by the new bmw i brand combines a plug-in hybrid drive system with a passenger cell made from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (cfrp) and an aluminum frame for the combustion engine and electric motor, the battery pack and the suspension. with this revolutionary concept and the emotional appeal of its aerodynamically optimized body design, the 2+2-seater – which was conceived from the outset as a plug-in hybrid – paves the way for an engagingly dynamic and futuristically efficient take on bmw’s hallmark driving pleasure. by cementing the brand’s new premium character, strongly defined by sustainability, in the sports car segment, the new i8 also demonstrates the broad spread and universal appeal of the bmw i philosophy.
the research and development activities carried out by the bmw group since 2007 as part of its project i initiative have laid the groundwork for a visionary car conceived with the impact of environmental, economic and social change around the world very much in mind. alongside its conceptual and technological development work, the company has also conducted field studies looking at the use of pure-electric vehicles in everyday conditions. more than 1,000 people have taken part in the studies, racking up in excess of 32 million kilometers (20 million miles) at the wheel. the knowledge gained as a result has been channeled into the creation of innovative vehicle concepts and mobility solutions.
