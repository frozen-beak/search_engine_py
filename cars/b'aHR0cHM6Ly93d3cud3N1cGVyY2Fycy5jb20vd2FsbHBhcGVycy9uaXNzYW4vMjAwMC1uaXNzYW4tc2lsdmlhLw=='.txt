japan saw a new version of the silvia (s15) in 1999, now boasting 250 hp (184 kw) from its sr20det engine, thanks to a ball-bearing turbocharger upgrade, as well as improved engine management. the sr20de (non-turbo motor) featured 165 hp (121 kw).
the s15 silvia included aggressive styling inside and out, updating the previous silvia styling in-line with modern car design trends. the body dimensions were reduced from the previous generation so that it would comply with japanese government compact class, which had an effect on sales of the previous model.
the s15 silvia model lineup was initially simplified to just the spec-s and spec-r, both models offering an “aero” variant with a large rear wing and side skirts/valances.
this generation of the silvia was only sold in japan, australia and new zealand but was available as a grey import in most other countries. in australia and new zealand the car was sold as the nissan 200sx.
