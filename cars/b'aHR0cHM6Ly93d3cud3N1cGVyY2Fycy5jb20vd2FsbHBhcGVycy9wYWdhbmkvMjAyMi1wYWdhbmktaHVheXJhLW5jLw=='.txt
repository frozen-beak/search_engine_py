another special one-off has appeared from pagani special projects called the huayra nc. at it’s beating heart is the familiar 6.0l twin turbocharged v12 engine which is this form is producing 819 hp and 796 lb-ft of torque. the drive is of course sent to the rear wheels fed by a 7-speed sequential gearbox. the outside is finished in a custom blue livery with red and white accents that serve to highlight various aspects of the bodywork.
with production of the regular huayra coupes and roadsters now officially ended, pagani is only producing special one-offs like the huayra codalunga and track versions like the huayra r. the successor to the huayra, which is codenamed c10 is well on it’s way, but we can expect that much like the zonda, there may be many more special huayras in the near future.
