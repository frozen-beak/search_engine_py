visitors to the atelier in molsheim are always intrigued to see the veyrons high-tech components being meticulously assembled into an automotive work of art. watching the car coming together, coupled with an admiration for the technical beauty of its structure, gave the designers the idea of finishing the car in its pure material configuration meaning no colour coating. the result is the eb 16.4. veyron pur sang, a two-tone study of pure materialness showing the cars true essentials: carbon and aluminium.
the carbon monocoque holds the engine plus the passenger cell, while the polished aluminium panelling is enhanced by reflections in the sculpted bodywork. interestingly, the rawness of the materials even more strongly highlights the dual character of this car: performance power coupled with cruising comfort, structure and body, dark and light.
a closer look at the details reveals the technical logic behind this stylistic appearance. the sophisticated monocoque contains all the core structural components, including the w16 engine, the passenger cell, the crash box and the linkages to the wheels. it is this purpose-driven fundament that is visible as the centre of the car in clear-coated carbon fibre.
