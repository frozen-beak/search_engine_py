introduced at the geneva motor show in 2015, this is the all new second generation audi r8. featuring lightweight construction, high revving v10 engine, and dynamic quattro awd. the r8 sits at the top of the audi food chain, as a high performance supercar, with looks to match.
gone is the ‘blade’ design feature on the sides of the car, replaced with an air intake pod that retains some of the blades iconic form. this allows the lines of the car to continue uninterrupted front front to rear, providing a more balanced overall look.
the v10 engine comes from the lamborghini huracan, making 532 hp in base tune. mated to the engine is a new 7-speed s tronic transmission that shifts gear fast and reliably. the all-wheel-drive quattro has been newly developed allowing up to 100 percent of the torque to be transferred to either the front or rear wheels as needed.
