bmw’s flagship electric suv now has an m version, with more power but the same ugly looks. called the bmw ix m60, it bumps up the power output of the two electric motors to 590 hp and features tweaks to the chassis to help match the extra performance at hand. 
there doesn’t appear to be many differences in the styling department for the ix m60, with m performance brakes with blue callipers and blacked-out wheels and badges the main points of difference. the battery pack is expected to be the larger 111.5 kwh version, with bmw claiming a power consumption figure of 21.6 kwh per 62 miles. that would give the ix m60 a 320 mile range in ideal conditions.
