back in the 1980s an audi s1 garnered a legendary reputation – it was the car that would see the brand dominate the world rally championship in its day. now the abbreviation is coming back – but this time as a road-going version: the audi s1 and the s1 sportback constitute the new flagship models in the compact a1 model line, adding an entry-level version to the audi s model portfolio.
