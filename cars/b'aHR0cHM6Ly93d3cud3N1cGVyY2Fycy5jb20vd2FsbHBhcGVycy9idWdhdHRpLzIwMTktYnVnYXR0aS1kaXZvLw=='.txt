bugatti have just trumped their relatively new hypercar the chiron with the launch of the bugatti divo. a car that shares the same mechanical under pinnings, but provides a sweeter handling experience for those who want a more nimble hypercar. the bugatti divo is limited to just 40 examples made, all of which have already been answered for by very well heeled customers. each divo will set back it’s new owner around £4.5 million ($5.78 million).
the now famous w12 quad turbocharged engine from the veyron and chiron is used again in the divo. power output is a very a strong 1,500 horsepower at 6,700 rpm, with 1,600 nm of torque between 2,000-6,000 rpm. top speed has been electronically limited to 380 kph (236 mph) so the cars true top speed will remain unknown, as to date even the chiron has yet to fully stretch it’s legs on a top speed run.
the styling of the bugatti divo is much more aggressive when compared to the smooth and sleek chiron, with visible aero attachments to the bodywork. the dominant styling cue for the chiron was the c-shaped bugatti line that shaped the side of the car, and followed through to the interior. the bugatti divo still makes good use of the c-shape line but it now ends half way up the side doors, allowing for aero elements to be placed on the side of the car. a big rear wing is now fixed in place, instead of the retractable unit used in the chiron. finally the divo has been put on a diet, shaving off 35 kilograms from the dry weight to now total 1,960 kg.
