the new mercedes-amg gt embodies the sensual purity of sportiness and emotion. the two-seater is characterised by hallmark rear-wheel-drive proportions. the v8 biturbo front mid-engine ensures optimum weight distribution, which forms the basis for superb driving dynamics. the long bonnet with its pronounced powerdomes, the greenhouse which has been moved far back, the large wheels and broad tail end make up the distinctive looks. the large tailgate conceals a practical luggage compartment.
the combination of aluminium spaceframe, v8 biturbo engine with dry sump lubrication, seven-speed dual clutch transmission in transaxle configuration at the rear axle, locking differential, sports suspension with aluminium double-wishbone suspension and the low kerb weight of 1540 kilogrammes delivers racetrack performance. the concept with front mid-engine and transmission in transaxle configuration makes for a beneficial weight distribution of 47 to 53 percent between the front and rear axle. in conjunction with the vehicleâ€™s low centre of gravity this translates into extremely agile handling and permits high cornering speeds. with a favourable power-to-weight ratio of 3.3 kilogrammes per hp, the mercedes-amg gt self-confidently lines up alongside the very best in its segment. the sports car also sets a new benchmark figure for fuel economy: fuel consumption of 30.4 mpg (nedc combined) constitutes a considerable increase in efficiency.
