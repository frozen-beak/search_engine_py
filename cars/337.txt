the 356 was built in four distinct series, the original (“pre-a”), followed by the 356 a, 356 b, and finally the 356 c. to distinguish among the major revisions of the model, 356s are generally classified into a few major groups. the 356 coupés and “cabriolets” (soft-tops) built through 1955 are readily identifiable by their split (1948 to 1952) or bent (centre-creased, 1953 to 1955) windscreens. in late 1955 the 356 a appeared, with a curved windshield. the a was the first road going porsche to offer the carrera four-cam engine as an option. in late 1959 the t5 356 b appeared; followed by the redesigned t6 series 356 b in 1962. the final version was the 356 c, little changed from the late t6 b cars but disc brakes replaced the drums.
in late 1955, with numerous small but significant changes, the 356 a was introduced. its internal factory designation, “type 1”, gave rise to its nickname “t1” among enthusiasts. in the us 1,200 early 356s had been badged as the “continental” and then a further 156 from autumn 1955 to january 1956 as an even rarer t1 “european” variant after which it reverted to its numerical 356 designation. in early 1957 a second revision of the 356 a was produced, known as type 2 (or t2). production of the speedster peaked at 1,171 cars in 1957 and then started to decline. the four-cam “carrera” engine, initially available only in the spyder race cars, became an available option starting with the 356 a.
