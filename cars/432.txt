limited-run 911 sport classic fuses the powertrain from the turbo s with a manual and rear-wheel drive. with the 911 turbo s stuck with an automatic transmission as the only option, this special edition is the only chance to enjoy the power of the twin turbo 3.7l flat 6 engine with a 7-speed manual transmission. that coupled with the exterior design and interior materials position this as one of the most intriguing 911’s in a while.
peak power and torque are rated quite a bit lower than the full-blooded turbo s with 543 hp and 442 lb-ft respectively. that’s a drop from 641 hp and 590 lb-ft, a penalty it seems for the manual transmission’s reliability limits. it is however still the most powerful manual 911 in the line-up.
