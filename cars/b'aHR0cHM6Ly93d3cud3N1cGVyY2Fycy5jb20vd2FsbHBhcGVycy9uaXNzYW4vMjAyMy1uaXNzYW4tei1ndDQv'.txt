nismo have given the nissan z a gt4 makeover, with the race car set to go racing for the 2023 season. conforming to global gt4 rules, it is based on a modified version of the road car and will be available for teams to purchase as an off-the-shelf race car much like the supra gt4.
it remains powered by the same twin turbocharged vr30ddtt v6 engine, but nissan are keeping tight lipped about performance numbers for the time being. obvious changes include a front splitter with canards on the corners, hood vents, rear wing and led centre brake light.
