ac schnitzer have released their upgrade kit for the new generation toyota supra, with more power and a more aggressive look. the visual modifications have been kept to a tasteful level, with a new front splitter, rear wing and 20-inch five-spoke wheels forming the main points of difference. the overall look is more menacing without going over the top, nice!
the performance side of things has been improved as well, with the standard 335 ps (245 kw) inline 6 engine now developing 400 ps (294 kw). the peak torque figure has also risen from 365 lb-ft (495 nm) to 442 lb-ft (500 nm). a significant improvement to both power and torque thanks to an additional plug and play control unit with an enhanced engine tune. all that extra performance means a minimum of 98 octane fuel is required to keep things running smoothly. ac schnitzer also offer a 3 year warranty to help back-up their confidence in the tune.
