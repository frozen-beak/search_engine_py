porsche has developed a new gt race car for the world endurance championship (wec) and the le mans 24 hours. the new 911 rsr is characterised by consequent lightweight design and sophisticated aerodynamics. the exceptional vehicle styling honours a very special anniversary: from a bird’s eye perspective, the numbers 50 and 911 are visible. these stand for 50 years of the porsche 911. the porsche ag team manthey works squad exclusively fields two porsche 911 rsr in the 2013 season.
the new porsche 911 rsr, which is based on the seventh generation of the iconic 911 sports car, follows in the footsteps of its successful predecessor, the 911 gt3 rsr. as with the production vehicle, the wheelbase grew by about ten centimetres. a new wishbone front suspension replaces the previously used mcpherson struts. another new development from porsche motorsport is the particularly lightweight racing gearbox. the six gears are selected via paddles on the steering wheel. the 460 hp, 4.0-litre six-cylinder boxer engine was taken from the predecessor and optimised in detail.
