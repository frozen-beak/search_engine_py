mercedes-amg has revealed their new all-wheel drive turbocharged hot hatch the a35, set to be take on the volkswagen golf r and audi s3 in the hotly contested segment. based off the current a-class hatch, the a35 gets the usual amg treatment with more power, better handling and more aggressive styling.
the 2.0 inline 4  m 260 engine uses a twin-scroll turbocharger to develop a total of 306 ps (225 kw) of power, and 295 lb-ft (400 nm) of torque from 3,000 rpm. performance is strong thanks to amg’s speedshift dct 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and mercedes 4matic+ all-wheel drive, which can split torque distribution from front-wheel drive only to a 50:50 split to the front and rear axles. 0-100 kph only takes 4.7 seconds and the top speed is electronically limited to 250 kph (155 mph).
“with the introduction of the a45 in 2012, we presented a real benchmark in the compact segment. the demand for our compact models has developed very dynamically in recent years. this success has encouraged us to further expand our portfolio and place it on a broader footing. with the new a35, we are fulfilling our brand promise of driving performance in every detail and offering thrilling lateral dynamics at the level of today’s a45,” says tobias moers, ceo of mercedes-amg gmbh.
