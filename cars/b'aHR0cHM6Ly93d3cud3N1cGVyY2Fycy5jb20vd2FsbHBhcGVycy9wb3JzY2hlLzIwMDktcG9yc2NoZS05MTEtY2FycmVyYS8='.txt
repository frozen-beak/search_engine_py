maximum output of the 911 carrera with its 3.6-litre power unit is up by 20 bhp to 345 bhp (254 kw). output on the 911 carrera s with its 3.8-litre power unit is equally impressive, up by 30 bhp to 385 bhp (283 kw). with this extra power, the carrera s coupé now offers a top speed of slightly over 300 km/h or 186 mph.
the new generation of the 911 is available for the first time with the new porsche-doppelkupplung (pdk), porsche’s double-clutch gearbox. offering no less than seven forward gears, the new gearbox combines the driving comfort of a converter automatic transmission with the dynamic gearshift of a sequential racing gearbox. and since pdk also boasts an automatic gearshift function, it replaces the former porsche tiptronic s automatic transmission on both the carrera and carrera s. through its optimised and adaptive gearshift programs, pdk improves the car’s acceleration and reduces fuel consumption to a level even lower than before.
