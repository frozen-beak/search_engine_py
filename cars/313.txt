audi is making a strong statement with the new audi s8 plus. with a power output of 445 kw / 605 hp and a top speed of up to 305 km/h (189.5 mph), the new audi s8 plus delivers even more enhanced driving performance. the new top model is reinforcing the brand’s position in the segment of premium class sedans.
“we have further sharpened our large sport sedan,” says prof. dr. ulrich hackenberg, board member for technical development at audi ag; he continues “the new audi s8 plus has a substantial gain in power and defines the pinnacle of sporty performance in the segment. that is why ‘plus’ appears in its name.”
one strength of the large sedan is its lightweight design. its body is made almost entirely of aluminum. its design is based on the audi space frame (asf) and weighs just 231 kg / 509.27 lb – which is the lightest among the competition.
audi engineers have further advanced the development of the 4.0 tfsi engine for the new s8 plus. the sonorous v8 biturbo engine now has a power output of 445 kw / 605 hp and a maximum torque of 700 nm / 516.3 lb-ft; in overboost mode, it can even produce 750 nm / 553.2 lb-ft. the large sport sedan – whose power was boosted 63 kw / 85 hp compared to the s8 – accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 3.8 seconds, and its governed top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph) can optionally be increased to 305 km/h (189.5 mph).
