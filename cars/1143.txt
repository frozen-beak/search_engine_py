exciting cutting-edge technology from affalterbach: the mercedes-benz s 63 amg and the cl 63 amg are to benefit from a completely newly developed powertrain. the amg 5.5-litre v8 biturbo engine with a peak output of up to 420 kw / 571 hp and a torque of up to 900 nm, in combination with the unique amg speedshift mct 7-speed sports transmission, contributes towards a considerable reduction in consumption and emissions, while at the same time increasing maximum power and torque.
the mercedes-benz cl 63 amg also features a new cutting-edge look: thanks to a new design the coupé has an even more athletic and confident appearance. the inclusion of the direct-steer system, torque vectoring brake and crosswind stabilisation as standard has resulted in another leap forward in terms of agility and active handling safety. new optional extras now available include active lane keeping assist and active blind-spot assist.
