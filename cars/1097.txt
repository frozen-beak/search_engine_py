refreshed x5 m competition is now the only m option in the range, and that’s not a bad thing. the regular x5 m is now longer available, with bmw deciding one m flavour for their performance suv’s is enough. this means everyone who jumps on one of these cars gets the full fat competition version with 616 hp and 553 lb-ft to play with.
new for 2024 is some refreshed styling, on the outside and a 48-volt hybrid assist system which involves housing a small electric motor in the eight-speed automatic transmission. this can deliver a further 12 hp and 147 lb-ft of torque during acceleration and help out with the x5’s stop-start functions.
