updated styling and the same turbo v6 diesel found in the s6 and s7, the new audi s4 gets a huge lump of 516 lb-ft (700 nm) of torque to play with. whilst only available for the european markets, the 3.0l v6 tdi engine is a strong performer in a market segment where diesel is still a popular choice. peak power of 349 ps (257 kw) comes in at 3,850 rpm and the top torque figure is available between 2,500 and 3,100 rpm.
power delivery goes through an eight-speed tiptronic automatic transmission onto the quattro all-wheel-drive system with self-locking centre differential. available in both saloon and wagon body styles, the s4 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.8 seconds for the saloon and 4.9 seconds for the avant. that’s slightly quicker than the s6 avant which takes 5.0 seconds. like it’s bigger siblings, the s4 has gained a mild hybrid system in the form of a 48v compressor. this supplements the conventional turbocharger, improving response where needed.
