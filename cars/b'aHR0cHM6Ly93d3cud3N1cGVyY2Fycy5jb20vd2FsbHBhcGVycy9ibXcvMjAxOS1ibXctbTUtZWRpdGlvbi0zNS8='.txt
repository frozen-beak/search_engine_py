it has now been 35 years since the inception of the the original m5 super saloon. bmw is celebrating this milestone with the special edition m5 edition 35, a car very similar to the 30 jahre edition m5 released in 2014. not content with a simple anniversary edition badge job, bmw have included many extra details that set it apart from the regular m5.
the performance is identical to that of the m5 competition, complete with the option of either all-wheel drive grip or rear wheel drive fun. this means 625 ps (460 kw0 of power and 553 lb-ft (750 nm) of torque, which equates to a 0-62 mph sprint of 3.3 seconds. the m5 edition 35 is painted in an exclusive frozen dark grey metallic colour, which features a special pigment to give it a unique satin finish. other exterior changes include large 20-inch wheels finished in graphite grey, housing either black or gold brake calipers behind.
the interior features a bmw first with the instrument panel, centre console and sections of door trim covered with an anodized aluminium gold carbonfibre effect. the seats  wear black merino leather with beige contrast stitching and the door sills are laser-engraved with the m5 edition 35 jahre name. each of the 350 cars made will have their production number emblazoned on the cupholder.
