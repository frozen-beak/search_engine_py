the unveiling of the bugatti eb 18/4 “veyron” design study not only created a stir in tokyo, but also signalled the start of a true success story; that of the fastest, most exclusive series production super sportscar in the world, the bugatti veyron 16.4. the inspiration for the study was bugatti’s outstanding history of success in motorsport racing, a fact which is reflected not only in the design and form of the vehicle’s interior, but also in the car’s name. pierre veyron was a works driver for bugatti and, during the 1930s, amassed numerous racing victories for the brand, celebrating his greatest triumph with bugatti at the 24 heures du mans in 1939.
the successful market launch of the bugatti veyron 16.4 in 2005 marked the beginning of a new era for the marque. fast on the heels of this 1,001 ps rocket, the veyron 16.4 super sport was released five years later and, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h, holds the world speed record. production of both coupés was limited to a mere 300 units, with the vehicles crafted at bugatti’s historical headquarters in the alsatian town of molsheim. these have been sold out since 2011.
the brand’s portfolio includes the open-top bugatti veyron 16.4 grand sport, which boasts an astonishing 1,001 ps, and the veyron 16.4 grand sport vitesse, which delivers 1,200 ps and holds the title of world’s fastest series production roadster. these roadsters are limited to a series run of 150 vehicles. as of early 2014, two thirds of these have already been sold, meaning that only around 40 vehicles are still available.
