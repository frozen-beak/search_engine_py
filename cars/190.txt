updates have arrived for audi’s rs e-tron gt, with more performance, revised looks and improved efficiency. when it first launched for the 2022 model year, the audi e-tron gt was a nice looking car, and thankfully, the 2025 model keeps the good looks going with some tasteful tweaks to the exterior styling. where the big improvement come though is on the mechanical side of things.
the rear motor is now lighter and more powerful, the battery pack is also lighter and has 12% more capacity at 105 kwh (97 kwh useable), the driveshaft has been strengthened and the cooling systems are more efficient for sustained performance. peak power has been raised from 636 hp up to 845 hp, which has resulted in the 0 to 62 mph time being reduced from 3.3 seconds down to 2.8 seconds. that’s a significant boost in performance that should pair nicely with and increased range of 378 miles.
