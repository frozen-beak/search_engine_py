to celebrate its 50th anniversary lamborghini have shown off a new exclusive model at the 2013 geneva motor show called the veneno. this will be a extremely limited release with only 3 units set to be made, making this prototype racer very exclusive. performance is as you would expect, being a big v12 unit with plenty of go fast aero bits carved through the cars body panels. it truly is a special car that will likely not be spotted on the road often.
that v12 engine is the same 6.5l unit found in the aventador, bit with even more power massaged out of it. peak power is now rated at 750 ps (552 kw) some 50 ps more than before, and the top torque figure has been increased as well to 531 lb-ft (720 nm). the 0-62 mph sprint is expected to clock in at an incredible 2.8 seconds, and the top speed should see the veneno go well above the 200 mph mark.
