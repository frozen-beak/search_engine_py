the all new sixth generation bmw m5 will sport an all-wheel drive system for the first time since its inception in 1984 with the e24 m5. bmw have chosen to incorporate the xdrive all-wheel drive setup to help harness the extra power from the 4.4l biturbo v8 and provide far greater everyday practicality and supreme poise. that power has risen from 552 hp & 680 nm of torque from the last generation m5 to a healthy 600 hp & 750 nm. the car is capable of sprinting from 0-100 kph (62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds and even 0-200 kph (124 mph) in 11.1 seconds, ensuring seemingly endless power delivery.
for those despairing over the addition of 4wd, bmw has included a 2wd drive mode, that will activate rear wheel drive only, and allow the driver to experience a traditional m5 setup and driving experience when they want it. to celebrate the new m5, bmw is offering a limited 400 unit run of the “first edition”. differences include exclusive frozen dark red metallic paintwork, 20-inch seven-double-spoke lightalloy wheels in black & the front grille, m gills and the four tailpipes of the sports exhaust all finished in high-gloss black. all changes remain of the cosmetic nature with performance the same between the two versions.
“the core component of m xdrive is a central intelligence unit with m-specific software delivering integrated control of longitudinal and lateral dynamics. the new drivetrain technology – making its debut on the new bmw m5 – therefore combines all of the agility and precision of standard rear-wheel drive with the supreme poise and traction of the all-wheel-drive system,” explains frank van meel, chairman of the board of management of bmw m gmbh. “as a result, the new bmw m5 can be piloted with the familiar blend of sportiness and unerring accuracy on both the race track and the open road – and in various weather conditions, too.”
