toyota’s rav4 prime brings more power and better performance to the popular hybrid suv. unlike the previous rav4 hybrid, the new prime model is a plug-in hybrid, upping the power output, improving the fuel economy and extending the all-electric range.
that electric range is quoted as 42 miles, which may pale in comparison to full battery electric cars on the market, but stacks up really well against other hybrids on sale today. it may even allow those with short commutes to do their daily driving in electric mode only whilst charging every night. fuel economy is rated at an impressive 94 mpg-e, but will only be achievable when the battery is charged up. running the rav4 prime on petrol only will see that number drop significantly.
the total power output of the hybrid powertrain is 306 ps (225 kw) which is 84 ps more than the regular rav4 hybrid. certainly more than enough for the average rav4 owner, and with a 0-60 mph sprint time of 5.7 seconds, the numbers back it up.
