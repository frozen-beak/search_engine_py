to commemorate the 50th anniversary of automobili lamborghini, the aventador lp720-4 anniversario is a limited run special with 100 coupes and 100 roadsters to be built. minor visual and aero changes have been made to the front and rear fascias with the front air intakes and the aerodynamic splitter getting enlarged and extended, and small flaps set into the sides. the rear end sees more extensive changes with an enlarged diffuser and expansive meshwork to further improve engine-compartment ventilation. all up these changes have increased the aerodynamic efficiency over the standard aventador by 50% without impacting drag characteristics.
performance has been increased for this model with peak power now 718 hp from the v12 engine. the anniversario keeps the carbon-fiber monocoque construction and permanent all-wheel drive setup of the regular aventador. the yellow paint job is a new option called giallo maggio (may yellow), and is a tribute to the most chosen colour of all lamborghini’s sold since the miura and references the founding of automobili lamborghini in may 1963. every lamborghini car built in the anniversary year of 2013 will feature the 50th anniversary emblem in the cockpit.
