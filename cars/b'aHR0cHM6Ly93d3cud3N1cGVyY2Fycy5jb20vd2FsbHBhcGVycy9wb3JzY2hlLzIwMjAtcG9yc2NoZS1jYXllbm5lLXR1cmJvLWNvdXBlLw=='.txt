after many rumors doing the rounds, porsche have launched the cayenne coupe, a sportier styled suv set to take on rivals such as the bmw x6 and mercedes gle coupe. whilst sharing the same running gear as the regular cayenne, the coupe has all new bodywork from the a-pillar back. this results in a roof line that’s 20mm lower, an 18mm wider rear end and shallower windscreen. in order to make the sloping roof line look more coupe like without compromising head room too much, porsche have separated the roof sections in two colours. this means that the outer coloured section falls away faster at the rear, whilst the black middle section cheats some extra room by remaining higher. this black area then proceeds to connect to the black rear spoiler. when viewed on the side profile the eye is drawn to the coloured sections which has a steeper slope than the roof actually has.
topping the line-up for the cayenne coupe is the turbo model. this is powered by the usual 4.0l twin turbo v8 that produces 550 ps (404 kw) and 568 lb-ft (770 nm) in this form. porsche says that the cayenne coupe will eventually get the panamera turbo s e-hybrid’s 690 ps (508 kw) powertrain, which would place it above the turbo model in the line-up.
