a fresh facelift for the audi r8 has arrived for 2019, bringing forth an improved new look for the german supercar. when the original audi r8 launched back in 2007, it was widely accepted as a good looking car that looked different to it’s peers at the time. the blade element down the side of the car was an interesting feature, and the overall design was rather handsome. when the new r8 came along in 2016 fans were left disappointed, as even with similar styling, the new r8 look was considered inferior to it’s predecessor.
now a few short years later, audi have tweaked the 2nd generation r8 design with a look that should please most fans. the front splitter and grille are wider with a thick bar dividing the front air inlets. the rear diffuser now protrudes higher up the rear bumper providing a more performance oriented look, and a wider air vent now stretches the whole width of the car. new ultralight fully-milled 20-inch wheels featuring a 5-spoke design finish off the new look of the 2019 audi r8.
two engine outputs will be available from the 5.2l v10 for the new r8, starting at the base models 562 hp and 406 lb-ft up to 612 hp and 428 lb-ft from the r8 v10 performance. those power figures are a small bump up from previous, mainly thanks to a new titanium valvetrain for the v10 engines. carbon ceramic brakes are now available as an option over the standard steel versions which help the r8 stop from 200 kph to 0 kph 5 metres shorter.
