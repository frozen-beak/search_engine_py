the bmw m5 cs has been revealed, packing more power and losing weight for better performance. much like the much loved m2 cs, the m5 cs will take it’s place as the most driver focused model in the 5-series m line-up. it will also be the most expensive, eclipsing the m5 competition by a fair margin, leaving a lot of work to do to justify the cost.
the main party pieces of the m5 cs are the acceleration times, power output and weight savings, all of which elevate the cs above it’s rivals in those metrics. starting with the power, bmw have tuned the 4.4l twin turbocharged v8 engine to produce 626 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque. that’s an extra 10 hp over the m5 competition with torque remaining the same. whilst not a big jump in power, it does look good on the spec sheet when compared to the mercedes-amg e63 s’s 603 hp figure, and we all know how important those spec sheet figures are! bmw will just hope you aren’t looking at the torque figures with the amg 45 lb-ft ahead.
the main advantage to the m5 cs lies in the weight reduction which measures in at 70 kilograms, placing the cs around 1,900 kg overall. this pays an important role in the 0-62 mph acceleration time of the cs, with bmw quoting a 3 seconds flat run, 4 tenths quicker the the amg.
