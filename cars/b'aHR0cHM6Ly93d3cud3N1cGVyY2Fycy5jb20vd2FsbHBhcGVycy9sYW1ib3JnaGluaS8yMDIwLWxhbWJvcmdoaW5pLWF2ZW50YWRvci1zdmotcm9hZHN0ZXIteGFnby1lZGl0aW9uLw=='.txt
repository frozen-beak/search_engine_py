lamborghini are celebrating their new ad personam facility with a limited xago edition of their aventador svj roadster. just 10 units will be available of the xago edition, a car that is mechanically identical to the regular aventador svj roadster but features some unique exterior and interior customisations.
inspiration has come in the form of the hexagon cloud shapes at the north pole on the planet saturn, and the inherent strength of the shape found in nature. lamborghini also utilise a ‘hexagonita’ theme in their design language. the exterior of the xago edition features a fading hexagonal silver effect placed on the doors and tops of the front and rear wheel arches. each of the 10 cars built will have an accent colour of the clients choice, with blue seen here in the wallpapers. gloss black nireo ad personam wheels finish off the changes on the outside, whilst the inside gets an exclusive seat pattern with hexagonita theme and splashes of the same accent colour from the outside.
