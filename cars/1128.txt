the new mercedes-benz a-class is opening up a new chapter in the compact segment: markedly emotive in design, with powerful engines ranging from 80 kw / 109 hp to 155 kw / 211 hp.
standing as much as 18 centimetres lower on the road than the preceding model, the new a-class communicates design and dynamism at the very first glance. this radical form language, presented and enthusiastically acclaimed around the world with theÂ a-class concept, was consistently implemented in the series production car. the appearance of the new mercedes-benz a-class reflects this new mercedes-benz design strategy. the result is what is known as a two-box design with a distinct character of its own, a sportily emotive exterior and an exceptionally high-quality feel to the interior.
