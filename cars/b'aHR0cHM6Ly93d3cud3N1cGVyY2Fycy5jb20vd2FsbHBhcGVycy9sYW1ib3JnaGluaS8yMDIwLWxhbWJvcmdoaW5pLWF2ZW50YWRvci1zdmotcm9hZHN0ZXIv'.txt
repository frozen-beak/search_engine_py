not long since the launch of the lamborghini aventador svj comes it’s roadster sibling, which loses the roof but keeps all the power and most of the performance. svj which stands for ‘super veloce’ and ‘jota’ denotes the car performance and prowess, setting the aventador svj and svj roadster at the top of the range of the aventador family.
the 770 ps (566 kw) naturally aspirated v12 remains, powering the svj roadster from 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 0-124 mph in 8.8 seconds a scant 0.1 and 0.2 seconds slower than the hard top svj respectively. the removable roof section is made from carbon fiber and is stored in the aventador’s front cargo area. each part of the roof weighs only 6 kilograms, helping the roadster keep it’s weight down to 1,575 kg which is 50 kilograms heavier than the hard top. all of the advanced aerodynamics of lamborghini’s ala system remain for the svj roadster, with the roof on or off not affecting the aero balance.
