the third all-new model from pagani has finally arrived, and it’s an 852 hp twin turbocharged v12 utopia. after six years in development the successor to the huayra is here, it’s called the utopia and will be limited to just 99 examples built. well until the inevitable special versions come afterwards.
with a focus on simplicity and lightness the utopia blends 50s and 60s design elements with a nod to the zonda with a blockier aesthetic. overall, the look may not be everyone’s cup of tea, yet you can be sure that every detail will be well thought over and the craftsmanship will be excellent as always. the launch colour as presented is perhaps not doing the design any favours as other finishes might just work a little better.
utilising the same 6.0l v12 package as the huayra, the utopia gets a further 24 hp more than the highest spec huayra with a total of 852 hp and 811 lb-ft of torque. thanks to upgrades to the valve train system, the rev limiter has risen to 6,700 rpm and the seven-speed xtrac automatic transmission has been lightened. also of note is the inclusion of an optional new seven-speed manual.
