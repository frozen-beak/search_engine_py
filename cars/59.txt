with the new gallardo lp 570-4 spyder performante, lamborghini is setting a new benchmark in the most fascinating automobile segment of all – the open-top super sports car. as “performante”, the gallardo spyder is even lighter thanks to cfrp technology, even more agile and even more dynamic. the new spyder performante is an automotive high-performance athlete that combines sheer sporting excellence and extreme performance with that unique open-air feeling that only a soft-top spanning the ten-cylinder power unit can offer. ultimately, every spin in the spyder performante is like a journey into the eye of the storm.
the gallardo lp 560-4 spyder is already at the peak of its game, bearing testament to the lightweight engineering approach pursued by the lamborghini brand. nevertheless, the engineers in sant’agata bolognese managed to reduce the weight of the new spyder performante by a further 65 kilograms (143 lbs). the open super sports car tips the scales with a dry weight of no more than 1.485 kilograms (3.274 lbs) – a new best for that highly exclusive market segment.
just like its “brother”, the gallardo lp 570-4 superleggera, the light weight of the spyder performante is due in large part to exterior and interior components made from carbon-fiber. these carbon-composite materials are perfectly suited to super sports cars because they combine reduced weight with improved technical characteristics. performance is optimized as a result of lower weight, while co2 emissions are reduced. lamborghini has been leading the industry for 30 years in the application of cfrp, and now the brand is expanding that lead even further.
