celebrating their 70th anniversary at rennsport reunion, porsche’s motorsport department have created a homage to the 1970’s 935 “moby dick” race car. based from a 991 generation porsche 911 gt2 rs, the 2019 porsche 935 is not a homologated car for championship racing, with all 77 examples expected to be raced at club motorsport events and at track days.
the most notable changes for the 935 compared to the gt2 rs is the long bodywork with big overhangs, a look that is characteristic of the 935 “moby dick” race cars of the 1970’s. the bodywork is constructed with lightweight carbon fibre composites, and the interior is fitted out with a full roll cage, carbon dash and bucket seats. full racing requirements in mind, porsche’s motorsport department have fitted air jacks for pit stops, a data logger and instrument panel from the 911 rsr, and an emergency escape hatch in the roof. the impressive red coloured wheels are 18-inch in size, forged with centre-locks, and a width of 11.5-inch in the front and 13-inch in the rear.
the mechanicals of the 935 are the same found in the gt2 rs, with the twin turbocharged 3.8l flat 6 engine developing 700 ps (515 kw) of power and 5553 lb-ft (750 nm) of torque. the same seven-speed pdk transmission is used along with porsche’s stability management system. weighing in at just 1,380 kilograms the 935 is lighter than the gt2 rs, which could result in faster acceleration times. porsche has yet to release any numbers in this area, but with the gt2 rs sprinting from 0-100 kph in just 2.8 seconds, the 935 will no doubt be very quick.
