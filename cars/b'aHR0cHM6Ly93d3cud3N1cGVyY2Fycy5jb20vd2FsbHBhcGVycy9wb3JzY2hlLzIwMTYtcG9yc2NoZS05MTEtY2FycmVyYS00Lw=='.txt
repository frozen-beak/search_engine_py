behind the re-engineered flat engines are more than four decades of porsche experience with turbocharged engines from motor racing and production sports car. the result is that all new 911 carrera models impress with top values in terms of performance, driving fun and efficiency. thanks to bi-turbocharging, the three-litre, six-cylinder engines in the 911 carrera 4 and 911 targa 4 achieve an output of 370 hp (272 kw) and a torque of 450 nm, while output in the s models increases to 420 hp (309 kw) and torque to 500 nm. this gives the driver an added bonus of 20 hp (15 kw) of dynamic performance to convert into driving fun. the greater power of the carrera s models comes from turbochargers with modified compressors, a specific exhaust system and tuned engine management.
in combination with the now electro-hydraulically controlled all-wheel drive, the 911 carrera 4 for the first time even achieves better acceleration values than its rear-wheel-drive counterparts. equipped with the options of pdk and sport chrono package, the 911 carrera 4 sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds (0.4 seconds less than its predecessor model), with the s model registering 3.8 seconds (0.3 seconds less). the cabriolet s and the 911 targa 4 with comparable equipment need just 0.2 seconds longer – the time it takes to blink. top speeds vary according to model and equipment between 287 km/h and 305 km/h.
