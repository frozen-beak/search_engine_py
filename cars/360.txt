ahead of its geneva motor show debut porsche has released the first pictures of the new 911 gt3 rs, combining the naturally aspirated performance of the gt3 with the aerodynamic look of the gt2. the front splitter if deeper, with bigger air intakes and cooling ducts at the front, and a bigger rear wing taken straight from the gt2 rs.
the new gt3 rs has benefitted from the gt2 rs, gaining lots of chassis components from its big brother. highlights include rose-jointing throughout, higher spring rates, recalibrated pasm dampers, optional ceramic brakes, lighter forged wheels and a bespoke compound for the 265/35 r20 and 325/30 r21 cup 2 tyres.
power increases are minor when compared to the previous gt3 rs model. peak power is now rated at 513 horsepower at 8,450 rpm, 13 hp more than before coming in 200 rpm higher in the rev range. torque has risen slightly, whilst the 0-100 kph time has remained the same at 3.3 seconds. the pdk transmission now provides faster shift times, the final drive is eight per cent lower, the limited-slip differential features torque-vectoring and is electronically controlled, and rear-wheel steering and dynamic engine mounts are now standard.
