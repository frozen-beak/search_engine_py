“our aim was to give the porsche boxster an even sportier expression with intelligently applied exterior components while simultaneously underlining the elegant look of the vehicle”, says techart’s managing director thomas behringer explaining the assignment to the team in the internal design and development department at techart.
the sporty look can be recognized straight away on the front and rear. the two-part techart front spoiler with integrated splitter flows perfectly into the design of the porsche 981 and allows the front of the vehicle to sit even closer to the ground. a fixed rear spoiler proficiently picks up on the sporty impression of the front and makes also a clear sporty statement. the exterior program is rounded off by plenty of details such as elegantly designed mirror trims on the side mirrors, decorative crosspieces on the side air vents or subtle trims on the rear and diffuser.
