in its design, the third-generation bmw m3 again follows in the footsteps of the first generation, albeit without spoilers and striking, extra-wide wheel arches. but thanks to the new front air dam with its integrated foglamps in elliptical design as well as large air intakes, the bmw m3 clearly stands out from all other versions of the bmw 3-series.
made of aluminium, the engine compartment lid is approximately 40 per cent lighter than a comparable lid made of steel plate. and a particular feature is that despite this lower weight, the engine compartment lid offers the same stiffness and crash safety as the steel plate lid on the “basic” coupé.
a further sign of distinction clearly visible on the engine compartment lid of the bmw m3 again sets the car aside from other models in the bmw 3-series – the so-called powerdome. precisely this is where the new power unit of the bmw m3 offers all its superior features, beneath this slight bulge in the middle of the bonnet.
