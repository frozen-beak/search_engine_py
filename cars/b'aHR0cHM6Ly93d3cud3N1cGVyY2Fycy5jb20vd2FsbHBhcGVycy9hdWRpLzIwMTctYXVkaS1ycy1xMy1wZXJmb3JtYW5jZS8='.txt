the new audi rs q3 performance joins the rs6 avant performance and the rs7 sportback performance as the third member of the rs performance family. as the sporty subsidiary of audi ag, quattro gmbh is responsible for these high-performance models.
the five-cylinder turbo’s power flows to a modified seven-speed s tronic with very short shift times. the lower gears are closely spaced for sporty response while the seventh gear is long to save fuel. the driver can let the dual-clutch transmission do all the work in modes d and s, or can shift gears manually using the shift paddles on the standard rs multifunction steering wheel. in the dynamic mode of the audi drive select dynamic handling system, each shift operation is accompanied by double-declutching. a launch control function provides full-throttle acceleration from a standing start.
the primary component of the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system is a hydraulically actuated and electronically controlled multi-plate clutch mounted in front of the   rear axle. the electronic controller combines stability, traction and driving enjoyment. power is distributed as needed between the front and rear axles depending on the driving situation. networking with the electronic stabilization control (esc) means that power is even distributed selectively to each wheel. as is typical for rs models, the esc can be deactivated and has a retuned sport mode.
