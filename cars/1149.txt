mercedes revised 302 horsepower cla35 is available in both sedan and shooting brake body styles, taking the fight up to the golf r estate. the 35 series amg models take their place under the full-blown 45 series models in the a-class and cla-class model lines. whilst not the most powerful version, the cla35 still gets to play with 306 ps (225kw) of power and 295 lb-ft (400 nm) of torque, which is sent through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and the all-wheel drive system. those are numbers were not uncommon to see from v8 powered vehicles in the 90’s, showing how potent even mildly tuned turbocharged 4 cylinder engines can be. being an amg model, mercedes have also fitted the cla35 with bigger wheels, rear spoiler, new front and rear aprons and a different front grille.
“the new cla35 shooting brake, with its expressive design, the agile vehicle dynamics and the flexible load compartment is an attractive alternative for young customers who lead an active life with various leisure activities. with the shooting brake we are offering these individualists access to the exciting world of amg driving performance, which is tailored to their specific requirements”, says tobias moers, chairman of the management board of mercedes-amg gmbh.
