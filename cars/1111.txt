the new generation bmw z4 is set to be a sportier package than it’s predecessor with a 50:50 weight distribution, a shorter wheel base and wider stance. the proportions of the new z4 fly against the grain of the previous incarnations that were known for their long bonnet and short overhangs. this time bmw have opted for more conservative proportions, giving the car more of a classic roadster feel. also different is the removal of a folding hardtop roof, opting for a lighter simpler folding fabric roof instead.
the z4 m40i is set to take it’s place at the top of the new z4 family tree that will be revealed later in 2018. the drivetrain consists of the venerable twin turbocharged straight 6 that is used throughout the bmw range. tuned to provide 340 horsepower in the z4 m40i, it’s not the most powerful version of this engine package, but a 0-100 kph sprint of 4.6 seconds is pretty quick. at launch the only transmission option for the m40i is an 8-speed automatic that will use bmw’s new gear selector or paddles behind the steering wheel.
