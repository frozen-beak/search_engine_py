novitec has revealed their visual upgrade pack for the lamborghini huracan evo rwd, but like those available for the other huracan models, no extra power.
the pack includes a front splitter that adds a little bit more downforce, intake shrouds that add some extra visual detailing and a new carbon fiber hood with more pronounced ridges. at the rear end novitec have fitted a rear wing, re-styled diffuser and a carbon fiber engine cover, whilst the sides are adorned with new wing mirrors, air intakes and staggered 20 and 21-inch forged wheels by vossen.
of course the modifications don’t stop there as novitec are offering a few configurations of exhaust systems from stainless steel to the much more expensive inconel version. the ride height can also be lowered by 35mm with sports springs or optional kw coilovers.
