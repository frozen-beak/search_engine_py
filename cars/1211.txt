mercedes-amg have unveiled the w15 formula 1 car featuring a switch away from the ‘zero sidepod’ concept of the past two years. in its place is a design that is more of a red bull-esque approach, something that most teams have followed due to their success. the livery has kept black as the prominent colour whilst bringing back a bit of silver along the top surface of the front half of the car. the w15 represents an important step in mercedes getting back to the top of f1 after struggling to make their 2022 and 23 ground effect cars to work consistently across the whole season.
