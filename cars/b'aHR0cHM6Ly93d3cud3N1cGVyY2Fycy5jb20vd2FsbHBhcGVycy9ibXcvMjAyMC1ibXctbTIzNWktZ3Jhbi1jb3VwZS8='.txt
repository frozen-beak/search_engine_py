bmw has brought the gran coupe body style to the 2-series, the first time it’s been available as a 4-door. after the success of the original 6-series gran coupe, bmw went on to create the 4-door coupe version out of the 4-series, 8-series and now the 2-series as well.
at the heart of the m235i gran coupe lies the bmw 2.0l turbocharged inline 4 engine that has been tuned for 3.6 ps (225 kw) of power and 332 lb-ft (450 nm) of torque. that results in a 0-62 mph sprint time of 4.9 seconds and a limited top speed of 155 mph.
the exterior styling is perhaps not the best bmw has achieved, with the headlights seeming a little too large for the body. the interior however is pure bmw with all the usual appointments and style one would expect from the luxury german automaker.
