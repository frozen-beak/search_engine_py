the new touring package for the porsche 911 gt3 gives buyers a six-speed manual transmission with no fixed rear wing and subdued styling all round. the engine remains the same as the normal gt3 with a stonking 4.0l flat 6 producing 500 hp and 460 nm of torque. the 0-100 kph sprint is a little slower at 3.9 seconds, though top speed remains the same at 316 kph.
the touring package name stems from an equipment variant of the 91973 11 carrera rs. the key then was puristic 911 design and classic interior features. the new touring package modernises this concept which is aimed at fans of high-quality sports cars who particularly value an understated appearance and classic driving enjoyment.
