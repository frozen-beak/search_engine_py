the e36 m3 debuted in february 1992 and was in the dealer’s showrooms in november that year. it was the first m3 powered by a straight-six engine; the engine used was a 2,990 cc (182 cu in) s50, which produced 210 kw (282 hp).
initially available as a coupé only, bmw introduced m3 convertible and saloon versions in 1994, the absence of any m5 models in the bmw line-up between the end of e34 m5 production in 1995 and the launch of the e39 m5 in 1998 prompted the introduction of the 4-door motorsport model.
the majority of e36 m3s were produced at the regensburg factory; however, a small number of low compression right hand drive m3s were assembled at bmw’s rosslyn plant in pretoria, south africa. in total, 46,525 coupés, 12,114 convertibles and 12,603 saloons were produced. the saloon ceased production in december 1997, the coupé ceased production in late 1998, and the convertible ceased production in december 1999
