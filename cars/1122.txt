mercedes-amg have let someone loose with the yellow marker as they show-off their limited edition a45 s clad in green with yellow accents. of course, the yellow highlights are a very deliberate styling choice that combine with the unique matte paint job, side door decals and interior embroidery to create a look which stands out. the visual styling is the only change made for the limited edition, with the mechanical package of a 415 hp 2.0l inline 4 turbo remaining the same.
