porsche has revived the t badge for the 911, the first time since 1968, holding firm to the originals light weight & short gearing philosophy. a lot of the effort put into the new porsche 911 t has gone into the light weight construction, designed to optimise sportiness of the car and provide an intense driving pleasure according to porsche. to achieve this, the rear and side windows are made from lightweight glass, most of the sound absorption has been reduced, and the rear seats have been removed.
the manual transmission has been fitted with shorter gear ratios, and the rear end gets a mechanical rear differential lock and the kerb weight is lower than the gt3 911. porsche has fitted the pasm sports chassis as standard along with a weight-optimised sport chrono package, 20mm lower suspension, a shortened shift lever with red shift pattern and sport-tex seat centres.
