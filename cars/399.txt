porsche is sending its second generation of the 911 carrera gts to the starting line. four models – a coupe and a cabriolet, each with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive – now close the gap between the 911 carrera s and the street-legal sports car optimised for the race track, the 911 gt3. some of the technical ingredients that generate even more driving dynamics and driving fun: 430 hp (316 kw) power, the sport chrono package and the pasm active damper system which lowers the car’s ride height by ten millimetres. improved efficiency has also led to quicker accelerations and higher top speeds, but combined fuel consumption figures remain unchanged at the favourable level of the s models. when combined with the porsche doppelkupplungsgetriebe (pdk), the 911 carrera gts sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 4.0 seconds (cabriolet: 4.2 seconds). the top speed of each gts model is beyond the 300 km/h barrier; the fastest at 306 km/h is the coupe with a manual transmission and rear-wheel drive.
when adjusted for their additional features, the new top models are attractive in price as well. a number of options are included as standard, such as bi-xenon headlights with the porsche dynamic light system (pdls) and the sport exhaust system for unmistakable gts sound. the driver and front passenger also sit in an exclusive alcantara interior with leather-trimmed sport seats whose centre panels are made of alcantara as on the other gts models by porsche.
