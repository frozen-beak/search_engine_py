the lamborghini islero was essentially a rebody of the 400gt, but the track was altered to allow for wider tires and while the isleroâ€™s body suffered from a lack of proper fit between the panels, its good outward visibility, roomier interior, and much improved soundproofing made it an improvement over previous models. it had a 325 ps 3,929 cc v12 engine, a five-speed transmission, fully independent suspension, and disc brakes.
