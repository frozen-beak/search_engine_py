a harder edge for the rs4 is coming, with the competition package set to up the ante against it’s biggest rivals. headlining the changes are three-way adjustable coilovers which feature a higher spring rate and new calibrations for the dampers to pair with stiffer anti-roll bars. these also allow the rs4 to sit 10mm lower to the ground, accentuating the new forged and milled 20-inch y-spoke wheels and carbon-ceramic brake package.
