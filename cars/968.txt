concept study of a bmw m3 by bmw m gmbh, dimensions and fundamental form based on bmw 3 series coupé, exclusive new engineering of almost every body element, purpose-built for individualistic form and maximum sporting potential. at the core of this concept study is an m3-typical v8 engine tuned to the high revving m concept.
front design conveying a high performance sports car, functional execution of the front apron and engine compartment lid, a robust powerdome and large air intakes that express the vehicle’s superior drive power, particularly voluminous air intakes for ample air supply to the engine compartment through the elimination of fog lamps, typical of m, and a front apron in a pronounced forward position that symbolises the car’s motoring spirit.
sharply defined wheel arches, gill-shaped openings in the front side walls with an elaborate three-dimensional design typical of m cars, and chrome brackets with integrated direction indicators.characteristic m-brand side skirts providing the side view with an energy-laden accent, visual emphasis of the rear-wheel drive and car’s wide track, 19-inch light alloy rims with the characteristic y-spoke design, exclusive exterior mirrors with an aerodynamically optimised design.
