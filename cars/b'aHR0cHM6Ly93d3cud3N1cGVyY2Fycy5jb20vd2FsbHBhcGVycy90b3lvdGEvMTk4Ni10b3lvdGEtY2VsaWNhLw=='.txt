in august 1985 the celica was changed completely. it was an all-new vehicle with front wheel drive, a rounded, flowing body and new 2.0l four-cylinder engines. the celica was no longer built on the toyota a platform, and instead realigned with the toyota t platform underpinning the toyota corona. the toyota a platform was now exclusive to the toyota supra. the coupe bodystyle in japan was used only for the corona coupe, sold only at japanese toyota dealerships toyopet store without the retractable headlights. an optional feature only offered on the corona coupe was four-wheel steering, not shared with the celica during this generation, however, the turbocharged engine on the celica was not installed in the corona coupe.
