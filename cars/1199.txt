mercedes-amg have released the most powerful e class ever, with over 600 hp and 850 nm of torque on tap. the twin turbo v8 is controlled by amg’s 4matic+ all-wheel drive system and a speedshift mct (multi clutch technology) nine-speed sports transmission fitted with a wet start-off clutch. this all combines to achieve a mighty launch from 0 to 100 kph in just 3.4 seconds. not bad for a luxury sedan and estate.
the exterior has been tweaked and fiddled to according to mercedes create sinuous edges and defined muscles. the car is wider than before and features broader wheel arches  with bigger wheels to fill them. the new design also reduces wind noise and lift, while allowing for agile handling characteristics on country roads and optimum driving stability at high speeds.
“the new e63 models represent the biggest step forward we’ve ever taken from one generation to the next. vehicle dynamics were especially important to us. at the start of the development process, we opted for a fully variable all-wheel drive system which, when combined with the advanced performance of the 4.0-litre twin-turbo v8 engine, reaffirms our brand’s “driving  performance” claim,” explains tobias moers, chairman of the board of management of mercedes-amg gmbh.
