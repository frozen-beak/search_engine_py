transferring the principles of sportiness and individuality into techart-typical design – this is the key demand made by techart on its new options for the porsche cayman models. the front apron with a techart two-part front spoiler, integrated splitter as well as re-designed and bigger central air duct gives the porsche cayman a more aggressive look and offers additional dynamics to the mid-engine sports car’s powerful outline.
the techart design vocabulary spreads to the vehicle’s rear via trims at the side mirrors and upright fins in the side air intakes at the rear wheel arches. the combination of a fixed techart rear spoiler, a rear diffuser with techart diffuser trim and central techart sports tailpipes completes the car’s exterior appearance.
