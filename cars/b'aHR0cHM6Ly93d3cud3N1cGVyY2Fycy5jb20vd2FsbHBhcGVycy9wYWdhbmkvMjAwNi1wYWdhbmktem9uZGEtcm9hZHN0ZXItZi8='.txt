hand built at the pagani atelier in a limited run of 25, the roadster f offers the outstanding driveability and performance of the f coupe, enhanced by the pleasure of driving with a gentle breeze in your hair.
thanks to an original roof made out of carbon fibre and cloth (removable in a few seconds) and due to the use of carbon fabrics for the construction of the central chassis, bodywork and interior, it was possible to maintain the dry weight of 1230kg, which translates in a weight/power ratio of 1,89kg/hp for the clubsport version.
now think about this; a light and rigid vehicle body, pushed by the mighty 7.3 litre mercedes-amg v12, with a power of 650hp and a torque of 780nm…..!!!! the 0 – 200kph time takes just 9.8 seconds and a few instants later you exceed the 300kph mark… all topless.
the roadster f travels along the boundary where beauty and power merge together forming something special; it’s sinuous and aerodynamically shaped bodywork gets its prominence from sharp edges and elegant lines, which show at first glance its extraordinary potential.
