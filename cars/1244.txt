making use of mercedes-amg’s gt3 and gt4 motorsport programs comes the limited special edition amg gt r pro, the most track focused amg ever built. much like the regular gt r before it, the pro has been tested and developed on the nürburgring race track, clocking up a fastest lap time of 7 minutes 4.632 seconds, making it the fastest lap mercedes-amg have ever recorded.
making all this speed possible are a variety of new aero elements including a large rear wing, bespoke turning vanes, front splitter and rear diffuser. all are made from carbon fiber with aluminium brackets were needed. the roof also gets the carbon fiber treatment, which helps reduce weight and lowers the center of gravity a small amount. the front fenders have large vents cut out to help reduce front axle lift, and the suspension has received a complete overhaul. the new coilovers allow for the manual adjustment of bump and rebound, and the front and rear anti-roll bars are fully adjustable as well. the rear axles lower wishbones retain the gt r’s uniball spherical bearings but with the pro using it for the upper wishbones as well, which help improve precision.
