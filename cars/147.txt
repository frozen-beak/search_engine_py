after the release of the special edition lamborghini veneno, the italian manufacturer have unveiled the roadster version. this will be another very limited release with production limited to only 9 units all made during 2014. those lucky enough to grab a veneno roadster will have to cough up 3.3 million euros for the privilege.
the mechanical specs are the same for both veneno’s, with the 6.5l v12 from the aventador pumping out 750 ps (552 kw) of power and 531 lb-ft (720 nm) of torque. dry weight has been increased by 40 kilograms with structural strengthening due to the removal of the roof. this means the 0-62 mph acceleration time has increase slightly from 2.8 seconds to 2.9 seconds, however it’s not something that would be noticeable in the road.
lamborghini have concentrated on an intense driving experience with the veneno roadster, with a truly open air canopy. since there is no roof section, a rollover bar has been integrated behind the headrests to provide the required safety standards.
