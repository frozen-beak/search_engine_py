bmw’s concept 4 has been unveiled at the 2019 frankfurt motor show, previewing the styling of the next bmw 4-series due out in 2020. in regards to that styling, lets start with the huge grille. the kidney grille has been a defining styling cue on bmw’s for a long time now, but recently the brand has started deigning them bigger. a lot bigger. with the reveal of the 2020 7-series fans got a taste of a dominant grille plastered all over the front of the car. the concept 4 has shown the world that this was not an isolated case, the big grille will likely permeate through the entire bmw line-up. if you can get past the front styling choices, you will find some nice touches, especially at the rear tail lights which we think look very good in the pictures. 
“the kidney grille has always been a signature feature of bmw cars,” reflects domagoj dukec, head of bmw design. “the bmw concept 4 presents a confident and classy take on this iconic feature. at the same time, the bmw concept 4 offers a look ahead to the expressive face of the 4 series range.” the vertically oriented grille fits seamlessly into both the proportions of the front end and bmw’s illustrious past. indeed, its form and design reference legendary classics such as the bmw 328 or the bmw 3.0 csi and therefore shine the spotlight on the bmw brand’s long and successful history as a maker of fine coupes.”
