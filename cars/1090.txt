after launching their compact suv aimed at a younger audience, bmw have released the new top model x2 m35i, with more power and sportier looks. those looks have always been a little polarising with its extroverted design helping to set itself apart from the crowd. now the m model has upped the game a little, with all the usual visual flares and touches associated with bmw’s performance cars. the wheels are big, the brakes are bigger, the front features larger openings, and the rear sports more aggressive tail pipes.
the powerplant of choice is bmw’s new 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine delivering 306 ps (225 kw) and 332 lb-ft (450 nm) of torque in the x2. this unit marks the very first m performance engine to be a 4-cylinder configuration, whilst also being bmw’s most powerful 4-cylinder ever made. with the help of the all-wheel drive xdrive system, an 8-speed steptronic transmission and launch control, the bmw x2 m35i can accelerate from 0-62 mph under the 5 second mark with an official time of 4.9 seconds. helping to control the extra power is the new m sport tuned suspension, which has been specifically tuned and adapted to match the car’s more sporty character.
