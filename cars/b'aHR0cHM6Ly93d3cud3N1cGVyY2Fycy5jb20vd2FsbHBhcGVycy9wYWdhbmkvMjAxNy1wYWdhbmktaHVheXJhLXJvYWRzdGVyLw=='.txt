paganis founding principle and cornerstone to their philosophy is: the combination of art and science. the new pagani huayra roadster certainly showcases the art of making all surfaces and components beautiful even down to the smallest details. this car is horacio pagani’s open air tribute to the gods of wind.
armed with the in house created material carbo-titanium, pagani has improved on the formula combining it with a new form of composite material, to achieve a remarkable weight that is lighter than the huayra coupe. the roadster boasts a 52% increase in stiffness when compared to the coupe version, which means the removal of the roof will have no impact on the rigidity of the vehicle.
the mercedes-amg built m158 engine has benefitted from the research and development done for the huayra bc, now rated at 764 hp with over 1000 nm of torque at 2400 rpm. a new 7-speed gearbox built by x-track is used, while the differential is an electronic version with an advanced control system developed in conjunction with bosch, to allow day to day drivability and track performance.
the roof of the roadster comes in two different flavours. one consists of a very light carbon hard top with a central glass element that is easy to put up and down and provides a look much like the huayra coupe. the other is a fabric and carbon cover which takes a few more steps to install.
