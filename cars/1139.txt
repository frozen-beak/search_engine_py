spectacular design, technology transfer from the world of motorsport and driving dynamics at the highest level; the new mercedes-benz c63 amg coupé black series embodies the new amg brand claim, driving performance, like no other amg model. the new high-performance vehicle is the most powerful c-class of all time, boasting a maximum output of 380 kw / 517 hp and a maximum torque of 620 newton metres. the amg 6.3-litre v8 engine impresses with its hefty torque, tremendous pulling power and responsiveness, and ensures high-calibre performance: the mercedes-benz c63 amg coupé black series accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds.
exclusive fun at the wheel comes courtesy of the adjustable amg coil-over sports suspension, the amg high-performance compound braking system and the functional standard equipment. the amg track package is available as an option to enhance driving dynamics even further. it boasts sports tyres and active rear-axle transmission cooling, plus the amg aerodynamics package including flics, a functionally tuned front splitter and an adjustable carbon-fibre rear aerofoil.
broad, low, brawny and ready to pounce from a standstill – the mercedes-benz c63 amg coupé black series makes a mighty impression. in visual terms the new high-performance vehicle is reminiscent of the sls amg gt3 customer sports car and symbolises the transfer of technology from the sphere of motorsport, which has been part of the corporate philosophy of mercedes-amg gmbh for 44 years now.
