bred for the enthusiast driver who craves track days as much as street drives, the 2007 porsche 911 gt3 is as at home at clubsport events as it is in everyday traffic. powered by a 415-horsepower, 3.6-liter boxer six-cylinder, the race inspired engine reaches its maximum output at 7,600 rpm, on the way to a lofty 8,400 rpm redline. these specs place porsche’s flat-six power unit at the specific-output pinnacle for current naturally aspirated production cars. 
the engine’s high-revving characteristics are made possible by the concentrated reduction of moving masses in the engine, with further optimization of air flow making significant contribution to the increased output. a variable-length intake manifold, combined with a larger, 82 mm throttle butterfly, optimized cylinder heads and exhaust system with lower back-pressure significantly reduce flow resistance versus the former model, improving the cylinder charge cycle.
the six-speed manual gearbox now provides shorter transmission ratio increments, taking the extended rev-range of the gt3 engine into account. on the road or track, this means acceleration from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in just 4.3 seconds, with the gt3 charging on to 99 mph (160 km/h) in 8.7 seconds. top speed is 310 km/h or 193 mph.
