the most extreme gallardo ever: the gallardo lp 570-4 super trofeo stradale. this new and most extreme top model in the gallardo lineup is based on the successful race car from the lamborghini blancpain super trofeo, the world’s fastest single-make series. the car will be produced in a limited run of 150 numbered units.
the lamborghini blancpain super trofeo championship brings professional racers and gentlemen drivers face-to-face in fiercely fought battles on europe’s most challenging racetracks such as monza, silverstone and hockenheim. there are many similarities between the racing and road versions of this super sports car. for example, they both share the same v10 powerplant, which is used in the racing version with no modifications.
right from first glance, these similarities are even more evident in the new gallardo lp 570-4 super trofeo stradale. in fact, it is equipped with the same rear spoiler that offers greater aerodynamic load – reaching in the best aerodynamic condition 3 times the load of the gallardo lp 560-4 – for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. as in the race cars, the rear spoiler can be varied manually in order to let the driver optimize the car’s performance according to the track or road characteristics.
