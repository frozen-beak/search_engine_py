a straight 6 engine up front with 50:50 weight distribution, rear-wheel drive and plenty of power, it’s the new 2-door bmw m4. featuring a new platform, engine, transmission and style, this generation m4 coupe in competition form is the most powerful m4 to date, and will even be launched in cabriolet body style by mid 2021.
just like the m3 competition which launched alongside the m4, power has risen to 503 hp with 650 nm of torque from the turbocharged 3.0l engine. those looking for a manual gearbox to operate their new bmw m car may be disappointed as the competition models only come equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission. it’s the regular m3 and m4 models that get a six-speed manual gearbox, denying the full performance options for those buyers.
other technical highlights include three-way adaptive dampers, two-way adjustable braking with carbon ceramic brakes, staggered 19-inch front and 20-inch rear tires and pre-programmable m1 and m2 modes selected via a pair of red steering wheel toggles.
