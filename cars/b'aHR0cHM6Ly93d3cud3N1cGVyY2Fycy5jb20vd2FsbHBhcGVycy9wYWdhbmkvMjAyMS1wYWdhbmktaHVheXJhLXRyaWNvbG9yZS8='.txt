pagani have unveiled a special tricolore edition of their huayra supercar in celebration of the italian air force aerobatic team. this isn’t the first tricolore pagani to come out of the italian supercar maker, as a decade before the huayra version pagani released the zonda tricolore finished in a very similar colour scheme.
the huayra tricolore matches the frecce tricolori jets in appearance with a blue body and the italian flag stripes stretching from the nose all the way along the side of the plane to the tail. the blue paint is translucent so the carbon fiber weave is visible underneath, and the wheels have matching blue accents painted on the inner sections.
the performance of the tricolore is similar to the pagani imola but with a little more power added into the mix. peak power now comes in at 829 hp which is a 13 h increase over the imola, and torque remains the same at 1,100 nm. only 3 huayra tricolore’s will be built with all of them in convertible form.
