to mark the 30th anniversary of the bmw m1 super sports car, bmw group design is presenting a homage to this legendary model as part of the concorso d’eleganza villa d’este 2008. the bmw m1 designed by giorgio giugiaro was a car of superlatives and a highly emotive vehicle that was uncompromisingly primed for the race track. 
spawning this development was the bmw turbo by paul bracq, a revolutionary concept car which, in addition to its groundbreaking functional design, also boasted a raft of technical innovations. it is from these two unique vehicles that the bmw m1 homage takes its cue – a design study that pays tribute to its forerunner models and an embodiment of the competence, creativity and potential of the bmw group design team.
“for bmw, heritage is always also a living heritage. drawing inspiration from your own past and thereby reinventing yourself – that is exactly what the bmw m1 homage demonstrates in impressive style.” dr klaus draeger, bmw group board member, development
