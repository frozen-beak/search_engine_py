“avant-garde meets driving performance” is the motto for the mercedes-amg models cla45 4matic and cla45 4matic shooting brake. these two cars offer a unique combination of a fascinatingly sporty driving experience, extravagant design and maximum individuality, while also benefiting from the facelift modifications. some items that were previously options, such as the led high performance headlamps, now come as standard. the twin louvre in the radiator grille is finished in silver chrome.
the aerodynamics have been further improved and the cd value reduced, all to the benefit of the driving dynamics and stability. in the case of the coupé for example, the design of the amg spoiler lip on the boot lid is new. further exterior features of the facelift include the amg front apron in a new a-wing design with front splitter inserts in matt titanium grey and high-gloss black flics. the latter also help to improve the flow of cooling air. new at the rear is the design of the diffuser insert, with four vertical fins. an amg aerodynamics package is now available as an optional extra. this comprises a larger front splitter, additional flics, a black amg spoiler lip at the rear plus spoiler lips over the simulated air outlets on either side at the back.
