for 25 years mtm has been marketing very powerful, special and craftsman-like interpretations of premium marques such as audi, volkswagen, lamborghini, bentley and porsche. the company will be exhibiting at the geneva salon for the fifth successive year and presents once again some exciting new models: none more so than the mtm s8 talladega s. the vehicle follows in the footsteps of the audi 200 that set some remarkable records at the talladega superspeedway, alabama in 1986: 650ps to break the 350 km/h barrier.
the current variant of the talladega s is a larger car but still manages the same velocity – thanks to a power output of 802 ps. this impressive combination is complemented by a luxurious but sportily chic interior comprised of bespoke carbon-fibre parts and hand-crafted leather.
