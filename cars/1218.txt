the world champions mercedes have unveiled their 2017 formula 1 race car. the livery design has changed for this year, reflecting the eq branding of new mercedes-benz road cars that will be released.
mercedes have enjoyed a complete dominance of formula 1 over the past 3 years. taking all 3 championships in both drivers and constructors forms. last year’s champion nico rosberg has sensationally retired, leaving teammate lewis hamilton to partner with valtteri bottas who comes over from the williams team.
the w08 already looks like a fast car. the amount of detailing across the bodywork and aero elements is astonishing, showcasing the enormous amount of work that mercedes has put into the new regulations. it will be interesting to see if their dominance continues, or if the chasing pack has managed to catch up. for the sake of good racing, let’s hope 2 or 3 teams can give them a good run.
