the bugatti eb110 was the forgotten supercar of the 90â€™s, overshadowed by the mighty mclaren f1 and left in the hands of romano artioli after bugatti automobili s.p.a. was liquidated. this prototype version was developed during 1990 in preparation for the release of the new supercar the following year in 1991. the eb110 would go on to be in production until 1995.
the styling of the eb110 prototype was different to that of the eventual car, with much more boxy sections and straight lines. the prototype also featured more cooling ducts across the bodywork, and barely had a curved line in sight. the rear wheel arches featured black flares, the wheel were a five spoke design, and the signature bugatti arched front grille was absent.
