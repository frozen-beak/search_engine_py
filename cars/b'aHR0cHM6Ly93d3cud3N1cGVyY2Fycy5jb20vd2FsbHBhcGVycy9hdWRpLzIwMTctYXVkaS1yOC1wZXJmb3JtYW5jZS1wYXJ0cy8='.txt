audi sport performance parts are now available as a retro fit range on the r8 supercar making it even more distinctive, sportier and faster. the package includes items that are part of the suspension, exhaust system, exterior and interior, changing the appearance, weight and performance of the elements replaced.
perhaps the biggest improvements can be seen with the added downforce of the r8, now clocking in at 250 kg (551 lb) at 330 kph (205 mph), an increase of over 100 kg (220 lb). even at lower speeds of 150 kph, the new aero kit doubles the current downforce generated. this will have a resounding effect on the race track, helping glue the car to the tarmac, increasing cornering speeds in high speed situations.
“with the audi sport performance parts we are tapping into a new business segment,” says stephan winkelmann, managing director of audi sport gmbh. “our wealth of experience garnered over many years of building sports cars is incorporated into every component we offer. along with our expertise from motor racing, which is still the best test bed for volume production.”
