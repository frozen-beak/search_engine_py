combining new lightweight technologies, active aerodynamics, all-wheel-drive system and more powerful drivetrain, the new lamborghini huracan performante strikes the balance of track car weapon and dynamic road driving.
the performante has claimed the production car lap record of 6:52.01 min on the nürburgring nordschleife in germany. though those lap times are completely un regulated, have no doubt that this is a very fast and capable car around a race track.
the significant weight reduction s achieved through the use of aluminum in conjunction with lamborghini’s forged composite. chopped carbon fibers are added in a resin to create complex geometrical shapes beyond traditional carbon fiber, to create a very lightweight and stiff material.
lamborghini makes use of active aerodynamics for the new huracan performante, with the front spoiler moving flaps to optimise airflow and generate downforce or reduce drag as required.
“the huracan performante is the convergence of technological developments to produce a car delivering perfect performance,” says automobili lamborghini chairman and chief executive officer stefano domenicali. “this new car represents the powerhouse of lamborghini dna and innovation, and a 360 degree approach to creating class-leading super sports cars. it illustrates the pinnacle of lamborghini v10 production car performance to date, on both track and road, and is   perfectly exemplified by its name: lamborghini huracan performante.”
