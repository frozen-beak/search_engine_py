the bmw 8 series stands out as a landmark model in a bmw coupe lineage that dates back to the 1930s. a clean-sheet design, the car tagged “e31” by its maker launched its challenge to the world’s finest sports coupes with a design oozing avant-garde elegance, arresting performance attributes, an exceptional wealth of innovations and a sprinkling of exclusive luxury. the bmw 850i presented at the 1989 international motor show in frankfurt represented a demonstration of the munich-based carmaker’s development expertise, revealing not only a cutting-edge new design line but also an unparalleled array of technological details making their automotive debuts. the design of the wedge-shaped body – headlined most strikingly by a long, swooping bonnet, smooth lines, the absence of b-pillars and a steeply cut rear end.
the bmw 850i, moreover, followed the bmw 750i luxury sedan introduced two years earlier as the second post-war german car to be powered by a 12-cylinder engine. the 5.0-litre unit developed 220 kw/300 hp and peak torque of 450 newton metres (332 lb-ft) to propel the 1,790 kg 2+2-seater from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.8 seconds.
channelling the engine’s power to the rear wheels was either a six-speed manual gearbox specially developed for the bmw 850i or a four-speed automatic, while its pioneering integral rear axle with five-link suspension was celebrating its premiere in the luxury coupe. automatic stability control plus traction (asc+t), speed-sensitive power steering and the electronic damper control (edc) system introduced as an option in spring 1990 were among the other details that helped give the bmw 8 series its distinctive identity as a driving machine.
