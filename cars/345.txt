the fastest 911 has gotten faster, sending off the 991 generation porsche 911 is the new gt2 rs clubsport, a track-only weapon with less weight and more downforce. thanks in large part to the usage of more carbon fiber parts, the clubsport tips the scales 80kg lighter than the regular gt2 rs, a significant weight saving bringing the total weight down to 1,390 kg (3,064 lbs).
the engine and transmission of the t2 rs clubsport has remained the same with a 700 ps (515 kw) twin turbocharged flat 6 and seven-speed pdk dual-clutch gearbox all doing the work. the forged alloy wheels are 10.5×18-inch units with center-locking nuts, running michelin racing rubber, a setup borrowed from the gt3 r cup car. the interior is fitted with roll-cage, bucket racing seat with harness and all the sound deadening stripped out to give the real race car experience. placed on the center console are a pair of rotary controls that allow adjustment of the psm stability management and abs system.
only 200 units will be built of the porsche 911 gt2 rs clubsport with the first deliveries starting from may 2019.
