ready for the 2020 season, mercedes-amg have given a glimpse of their revised gt3 challenger which will be run by teams in the 10th year of mercedes-amg customer racing program. the program started back in 2010 with the introduction of the sls amg gt3, which was replaced by the first mercedes-amg gt3 in 2015. mercedes set new standards for performance, safety, reliability, handling and ergonomics, making the gt3 one of the most successful gt3 cars to date.
the 2020 model has been designed to improve upon most aspects of the car, with particular attention paid to reducing the running costs for teams. the naturally aspirated 6.3l v8 has been tweaked to allow for longer running times, lowering the frequency of engine rebuilds needed. parts of the front section have been redesigned to allow better protection of the steering, engine and front axle in accidents, which should equate to less parts needing to be changed or fixed.
