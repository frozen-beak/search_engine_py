the porsche 911 black edition offer the core 911 principles of distinctive design with inner strength; with a high level of specification that emphasises the iconic styling of the car and enhances the interior, while retaining the authentic sporting character of the driving experience.
available in just 1,911 examples worldwide, the porsche 911 black edition is painted in plain black as standard, with basalt black metallic available as an option. the electric-folding hood of the cabriolet model is trimmed in black cloth. exterior highlights are provided by the 19-inch 911 turbo ii forged alloy wheels, the glossy metallic appearance of which perfectly complements the discreet elegance of these 911 models. in addition, the wheel rims provide an unobstructed view of the brake discs which are naturally paired with black-finished, four-piston aluminium monobloc fixed callipers.
black lettering on the stainless steel door entry guards identifies each ‘black edition’, and provides a first hint of the high-quality interior design with its focus on pure sports car values. inside, the colour theme of the exterior continues with a black leather interior, and facing the driver is a thick-rimmed sportdesign steering wheel. the instrument cluster naturally remains in black. on the glove compartment lid, a badge testifies to the limited production run of the porsche 911 black edition. by way of contrast, the decorative fascia strip, gear lever and air vents are finished in aluminium-look paint. the rear centre console is painted in the exterior colour.
