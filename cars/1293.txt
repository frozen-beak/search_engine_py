with the completely redeveloped sl, mercedes-benz continues a tradition that began 60 years ago. the letters “sl” have ever since been synonymous with a symbiosis of sportiness, style and comfort – and with groundbreaking innovations. the new mercedes-benz sl-class has been produced for the first time almost entirely from aluminium and weighs up to 140 kilograms less than its predecessor. its highly rigid all-aluminium bodyshell provides the basis for agile, sporty handling that has been taken to an entirely new level, coupled with exemplary roll characteristics and ride comfort. 
even better driving dynamics come courtesy of the new bluedirect engines; they are more powerful yet at the same time up to 29 percent more economical than the engines in the outgoing generation. other new features include the unique frontbass system, which turns the luxury sports car into a concert hall regardless of whether the top is open or closed, and the highly efficient adaptive windscreen wipe/wash system magic vision control; it supplies water from the wiper blade as required and depending on the direction of wipe.
