new c43 amg opts for a mild-hybrid 4 cylinder with over 400 horsepower to kick off this generation of performance c-classes. with the upcoming c63 expected to also run with a hybrid 4 cylinder setup, the c43 gives us an early look at what to expect. peak power has been rated at 402 hp with 369 lb-ft of torque from the 2.0l turbocharged powerplant. the mild-hybrid aspect uses mercedes 48v electrical system to electrically assist the turbocharger and includes an additional belt-driven starter generator that kicks in 14 extra hp into the total output.
the transmission of choice is a 9-speed mct automatic that utilises a wet clutch on take-off, working in tandem with a rear-biased all-wheel drive system that sends up to 69 per cent of drive to the rear wheels.
