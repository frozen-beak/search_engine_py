mercedes has given a glimpse at the possible future electric s-class in the form of the vision eqs concept. the styling features a smooth flowing form which mercedes calls a ‘stretched “one bow” design’. of course the eqs has plenty of concpet car drama about it with the three-pointed star-shaped leds used throughout, the overall aesthetic gives a good look into the way the brand envisions their future.
built on a completely new all-electric platform, mercedes have developed a modular layout that can adapt as needed. the battery pack, like others, is nestled low in the floor between both axles. they are can scale the wheelbase, track and battery size as required for different vehicles, meaning this new platform wil likely be used across a wide variety of cars.
the eqs concept has utilised an electric motor for each axle, combining for over 476 ps (350 kw) of power and 560 lb-ft (759 nm) of torque. the 100 kwh lithium battery pack helps the eqs achieve a wltp-equivalent range of around 435 miles, and is compatible with up to 350 kw charging when it becomes available.
