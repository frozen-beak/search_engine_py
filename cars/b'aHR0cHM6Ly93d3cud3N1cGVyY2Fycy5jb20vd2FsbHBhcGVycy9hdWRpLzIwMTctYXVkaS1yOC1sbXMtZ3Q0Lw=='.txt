the audi r8 v10 is now available as a customer ready gt4 spec racing car, which can be purchased and raced straight out of the box. audi has enjoyed a lot of success in racing since the launch of the r8 with victories across the globe. as they continue to field their cars in different series, audi show how capable they are of providing very competitive racing cars in any category.
to comply with gt4 rules and regulations, power from the 5.2l v10 has been dropped to 495 hp, and the whole car shares 60% of its parts with the road going r8. in all, the gt4 spec is much less extreme than the higher gt3 and gte classes which utilise many more aero elements to increase grip and speed.
there are 13 gt4-spec car series around the world including the continental tire sports car challenge’s gt class and the pirelli world challenge gts class in the united states. this r8 lms gt4 is set to make its debut at the upcoming nürburgring 24 hours race.
