continuing their 75th birthday celebrations, porsche have gifted themselves an all-new electric hypercar. designed with the goal of being the fastest road-legal car around the nürburgring nordschleife, the mission x concept will very likely make it into production as porsche’s most extreme road car ever.
porsche is developing a new electric powertrain for the mission x, based on a 900-volt architecture with the help of rimac automobili. each wheel is set to have its own motor for a combined output of 1,500 horsepower and a low weight of only 1,500 kilograms. downforce is also expected to be impressive if porsche is to achieve a record lap time around the ring.
