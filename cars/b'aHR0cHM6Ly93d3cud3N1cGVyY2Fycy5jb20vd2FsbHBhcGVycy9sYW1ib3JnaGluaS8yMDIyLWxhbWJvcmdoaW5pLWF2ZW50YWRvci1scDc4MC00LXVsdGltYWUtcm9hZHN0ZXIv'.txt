the final aventador roadster is sending off the naturally aspirated v12 lamborghini with style. with only 250 roadsters to be built in ultimae guise, these are set to become future collectables that could represent the one of the best examples of the v12 lamborghiniâ€™s of the past.
the formula for the ultimae is simple. take the powertrain of the mighty track-focused aventador svj, add in a little more power, and combine it with the more comfortable aventador s chassis and interior.
