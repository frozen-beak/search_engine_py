after all the teases, concepts and race cars, the production ready bmw 8-series has finally made its return. the 8-series coupe will launch with the choice of the straight-six diesel powered 840d, and the twin-turbo v8 powered m850i. the m850i as pictured makes use of a newly revised versions of bmws 4.4l v8 engine that now develops peak power of 530 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and peak torque of 750 nm between 1,800 and 4,600 rpm.
acceleration is aided by bmws xdrive all-wheel drive system, and upgraded eight-speed automatic gearbox that includes an integrated launch-control function. the 0-100 kph sprint is dispatched in 3.7 seconds. construction is made up of a combination of high-strength steel, aluminium and a pinch of carbonfibre, which should help keep the cars weight under the 2 tonne mark. bmw has blessed the new 8-series with a bevy of new technology including active chassis elements. these comprise of active rear-wheel steering and optional active roll stabilisation. the system should be capable of utilising these features on an as needed basis to aid vehicle control.
