audi has incorporated the name and the genes of the five-time le mans winner, the audi r8, into a spectacular sports car. three years after the unveiling of the audi le mans quattro concept car, the production version will be making its debut at the paris motor show in the guise of the new audi r8 mid-engined sports model.
it is a fascinating driving machine and the sporty pinnacle of the audi brand. the mid-mounted 420 bhp v8 fsi engine, quattro permanent four-wheel drive and audi space frame aluminium body form the basis for truly outstanding driving dynamics. as the first audi mid-engined sports car, the r8 combines audi’s experience gained from numerous motorsport triumphs with groundbreaking design and the acknowledged technological expertise of the brand. this expertise has led to the slogan ‘vorsprung durch technik’ becoming a byword for leading-edge technology both on the race track and on the road.
