a nissan gt-r is always special, but a v-spec model is that little bit extra special. the mid 1990’s saw the r33 skyline get the gt-r v-spec treatment, adding some go faster goodies to the gt-r mixture. when compared to the r32 and r34, the r33 suffered a bit as the middle child, with the majority of fans looking more favorably upon it’s older and younger siblings.
surprisingly the v-spec was 10 kilograms heavier than the regular gt-r, this was due to the new components, but they more than made up for the extra heft. these included a four-wheel independent channel anti-lock braking system, active limited slip differential and a newer attesa e-ts pro all wheel drive system.
