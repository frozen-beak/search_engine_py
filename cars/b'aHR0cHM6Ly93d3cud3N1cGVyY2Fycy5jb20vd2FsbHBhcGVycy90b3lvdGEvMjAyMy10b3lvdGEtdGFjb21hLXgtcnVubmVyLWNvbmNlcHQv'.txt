toyota’s x-runner concept has a go at bringing back the sport truck with a lowered, modified tacoma. adam rabinowitz, chief designer at toyota’s calty design research, inc. shared a part of the team’s thought process. “there were lots of street trucks in the early 2000s and they all faded, so on the one hand, this was a curiosity check to see if there is any market for street trucks at all, or if the market has entirely shifted to what we see today-tough, rugged, lifted vehicles.”
