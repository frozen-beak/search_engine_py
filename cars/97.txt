novitec torado is further expanding its exclusive refinement program for the sports cars from lamborghini: tailor-made customization options are now also available for the huracan. in a first step, novitec torado offers aerodynamic-enhancement components optimized in the wind tunnel,  high-tech forged wheels with matching suspension modifications, high-performance exhaust systems and exclusive options for the interior.
the novitec torado designers have developed an equally spectacular and aerodynamically efficient aerodynamic-enhancement kit to add even more extreme emphasis to the wedge-shaped design of the lamborghini huracan. the new bodywork conversion makes the mid-engine sports car even more of a superior eye-catcher and further improves its handling stability at high speeds. the precise-fit novitec torado aerodynamic-enhancement components can be painted in vehicle or contrasting color. alternatively, all components can also be ordered with a clear-coated carbon-fiber finish for that full-blooded racing look.
