following on from the sales success of the camry xse, toyota racing development (trd) are releasing a track tuned 301 horsepower version of the camry. the exterior changes include matte-black 19 x 8.5-inch alloy wheels wrapped with bridgestone potenza 235/40r19 tyres and a new trd body kit. the front bumper features a unique gloss black front grille with sport mesh insert and black exterior badging, whilst the whole car has received a gloss black lower lip kit with side skirts. polished stainless steel exhaust tips highlight the rear with a trd wing completing the new look. colour options comprise of the two-toned supersonic red, windchill pearl and celestial silver metallic, as well as midnight black metallic.
the toyota camry trd is powered by a 3.5l dohc v6 that is good for 300 ps (221 kw) and thanks to the new free breathing cat-back dual exhaust, sounds the part as well. the 8-speed automatic transmission has a sport mode and paddle shifters. the camry trd went through extensive testing at toyota arizona proving ground, tmc higashi-fuij proving ground, and motorsport ranch in texas. this has resulted in stiffer coil springs and front/rear sway bars, helping to increase roll stiffness of 44% in the front and 67% in the rear. a specially tuned set of trd dampers have also been added to compliment the spring changes.
