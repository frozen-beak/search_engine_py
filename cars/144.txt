after many years of teasers and leaks, lamborghini have finally revealed their new 641 horsepower urus 4×4, a car they calling the ‘super suv’. the performance numbers are very impressive for a big car tipping the weights at over 2 tonnes, with 0-100 kph going past in 3.6 seconds and then 0-200 kph in 12.8 seconds. the top speed is set to be over 300 kph making the lamborghini urus the fastest suv available for its launch in 2019. all this performance is thanks to the twin turbocharged v8 borrowed from the porsche panamera turbo and cayenne turbo. in the urus the engine makes more power than in the porches, which helps provide a good power to weight ratio of 3,38 kg/hp.
other parts shared with the cayenne are the eight-speed automatic gearbox, a torque vectoring rear differential, electromechanical variable rate anti-roll bars and a rear-wheel steering system. even the same ride height altering three-chamber air suspension system is borrowed. one key difference with this setup is the differential, with the urus using a fixed ratio that sends 60 per cent of the torque to the rear and the remaining 40 to the front.
“the lamborghini urus is a visionary approach based on the infusion of lamborghini dna into the most versatile vehicle, the suv. the urus elevates the suv to a level not previously possible, the super suv. it is a true lamborghini in terms of design, performance, driving dynamics and emotion as well as drivable every day in a range of environments,” says stefano domenicali, automobili lamborghini chairman and chief executive officer. “the urus fits perfectly within the lamborghini family as a high performance car. it is the culmination of intensive development and passionate skill to create a new breed of bull: a super suv that transcends the boundaries of expectations and opens the door to new possibilities, for both our brand and our customers.”
