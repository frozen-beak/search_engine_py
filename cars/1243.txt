mercedes-amg are releasing the roadster version of their amg gt r, complete with all the same gear from the coupe and a limited production run of 750 units. the gt r roadster has a very healthy 585 ps (430 kw) and 516 lb-ft (700 nm) on tap thanks to the twin turbocharged 4.0l v8. peak torque is mustered up from as little as 2,100 rpm, providing tremendous driveability. the performance of the roadster remains the same as the coupe despite carrying some extra weight. 0-62 mph is done in 3.6 seconds and the top speed as still rated at 197 mph.
“the new amg gt r roadster is far more than the combination of the thrilling vehicle dynamics of the gt r with the special flair of our gt roadsters. it is the essence of two worlds, blending to deliver our brand pledge, driving performance, in a very special way. with our gt r roadster we have without doubt once again developed a brand-defining sports car. it too embodies mercedes-amg in form, function and vehicle dynamics and enriches our gt family with a highly exclusive variant limited to 750 units”, says tobias moers, chairman of the management board of mercedes-amg gmbh.
