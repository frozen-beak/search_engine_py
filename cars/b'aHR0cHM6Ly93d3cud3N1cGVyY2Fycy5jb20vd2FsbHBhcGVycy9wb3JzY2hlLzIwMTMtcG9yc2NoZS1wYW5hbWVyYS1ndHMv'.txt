more power and upgraded brakes, a body lowered by ten millimetres and the especially sportily tuned chassis with air suspension and pasm are the major technical modifications that make porsche panamera gts the model capable of cutting it on the racing circuit – without sacrificing practicality. the sportiest of all panamera models also conveys this to occupants and the outside world by its striking sound. in terms of looks, the new porsche panamera gts signals its independence by distinctive design features in the front-end, side and rear area as well as black highlights. the interior as well is rigorously tailored to the sporty personality with sports seats, sportdesign steering wheel with shift paddles, exclusive gts leather interior and alcantara surfaces.
the power unit in the new porsche panamera gts is a modified 4.8-litre naturally aspirated v8 engine, delivering 430 hp (316 kw) at 6,700 rpm, trumping the engine in its panamera s/4s sister models by 30 hp (22 kw). the maximum torque also increased by comparison, from 500 nm to 520 nm. the way in which at the push of a button the porsche doppelkupplungsgetriebe (pdk) transmits the engine output to the all-wheel drive (ptm) -thanks to the sport chrono package featured as standard without interruption to the power flow -is especially dynamic. this collaboration enables the porsche panamera gts to sprint to 100 km/h in under 4.5 seconds, accelerating on to its top speed of 288 km/h.
