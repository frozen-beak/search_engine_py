spinning up to 9,500 rpm, the new l545 v12 engine is a heavily re-engineered version of the v12 developed for the original aventador back in 2012. it is the lightest and most powerful lamborghini production v12 to date and produces 814 hp and 531 lb ft of torque on its own. when combined with the trio of electric motors, the total system output rises to a massive 1,001 hp topping its main rival the ferrari sf90 stradale.
