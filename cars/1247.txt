mercedes performance marque amg has produced another in house special with a 4-door variant of the gt, to go alongside the original 2-door sports coupe. the new gt 4-door keeps the design features of the gt and elongates the proportions to accommodate 2 more doors whilst keeping a coupe like form. the end result is familiar to the audi s7 and porsche panamera.
the top line gt 63 s comes a stonking 639 horsepower and 900 nm of torque which is available from 2,500 to 4,500 rpm. mercedes 4matic+ all-wheel drive system is used to keep all that power in check and help put down a 0-100 kph sprint of 3.2 seconds. for those who want a little fun on the track, the 4matic+ will feature a rear-wheel drive mode that will make the gt 4-door and drifting machine.
“the new amg gt 4-door coupe blends the impressive racetrack dynamism of our two-door sports car with maximum suitability for everyday use. it has a unique way of embodying our brand core, “driving performance” and with its systematic configuration it will attract new customers for mercedes-amg”, commented tobias moers, ceo of mercedes-amg gmbh.
