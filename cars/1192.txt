mercedes-benz will be showing a compact premium-class suv at the 2013 “auto shanghai” motor show in the form of its concept gla. the concept gla combines dynamic styling with clear benefits for recreational use. under the bonnet of this new concept vehicle sits a four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine rated at 155 kw / 211 hp with a displacement of 1991 cc. its power is transmitted to the road via the 7g-dct dual clutch automatic transmission and 4matic all-wheel drive. a new approach is taken here in the form of headlamps featuring laser technology: these not only shine more light on the road, but also function as projectors.
“the concept gla marks a new approach for us in the compact suv segment – this is a sporty and more coupé-like evolution of this category of vehicle”, commented dr joachim schmidt, executive vice president mercedes-benz cars, sales and marketing. “the concept gla is a compact suv that combines its sporting spirit with the all-round qualities of a tough, leisure-time companion. ‘escape the everyday’ is the message that this car conveys to its driver. it also makes clear the further potential of our compact vehicle architecture, which provides the basis for the a-class and b-class models that led the german market in their respective segments in the first quarter of 2013.”
