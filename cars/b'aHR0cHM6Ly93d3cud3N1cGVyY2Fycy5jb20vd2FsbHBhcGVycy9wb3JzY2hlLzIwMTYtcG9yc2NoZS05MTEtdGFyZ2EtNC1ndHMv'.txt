to mark the 50th anniversary of the 911 targa, porsche is offering this very popular model in the more powerful and dynamic gts version for the first time. the targa concept of the 911 targa 4 gts delivers very safe driving enjoyment with all-wheel drive and a rollover protection bar; it also delivers open-air fun with a targa top that stows fully automatically.
contributing to a boost in dynamic performance are the 430 hp (316 kw) gts engine together with the standard sport chrono package, pasm chassis, 20-inch wheels and a sport exhaust system.
despite its significantly extended features, the weight-to-power ratio with the 430-hp engine was improved from 3.9 kg to just 3.6 kg per horsepower compared to the s model. this lets the targa 4 gts reach a top speed of over 300 km/h (186 mph) with a pdk transmission, and the stopwatch records 4.3 seconds for the sprint from zero to 100 km/h (0 – 60mph in 4.1 seconds).
