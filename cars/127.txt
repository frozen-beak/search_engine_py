the novitec torado lamborghini aventador is more exquisite than ever thanks to the aerodynamic-enhancement kit, which was especially developed in the wind tunnel. other highlights are the high-tech forged wheels, the engine tuning thanks to which the car produces 1000 ps, high-performance exhaust system with electronic sound management, a coil-over suspension and exclusive interior options.
the enhanced lamborghini aventador now features aerodynamic-enhancement components, which depending on customers’ preferences are painted in the exterior color of the vehicle or in contrasting one. they are all also offered in a clear-coated carbon-fiber version.
the front fascia of this lamborghini has more aggressive look thanks to the new body components featured. they have demonstrated in the wind tunnel that they are capable of reducing the negative lift on the front axle and therefore to additionally further enhance the handling stability at high speeds.
in addition, to the front is also added an upgrade with the two-piece novitec torado front spoiler on the left and right, the central front blade, newly designed air intakes, new trunk lid with integrated air ducts and the new air vents in front of the windshield.
