the first generation bmw m3 was based on the 1986 bmw 3-series e30, and although looking very similar shared very little body panels – only the hood and roof. it was powered by a specially developed 2.3 liter inline 4-cylinder engine producing 195 hp (143 kw) fitted with a 5-speed manual gearbox. this remarkable peace of engineering allowed the bmw m3 e30 to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 7.2 seconds and reach a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph).
the bmw m3 utilised a widened and heavily redesigned variation of the coupe body style, therefore the m3 shares few body parts with other e30 models. the m3 suspension is also significantly different from regular e30 models, including five-lug wheel bolts.
the hand-build bmw m3 cabriolet was introduced in 1988 producing 215 hp (160 kw) and capable of reaching 239 km/h (148 mph) making it the fastest four-seater cabriolet at that time. with only 786 units ever produced is quite rare
