like the saloon and estate models, mercedes-benz has completely revised the coupé and cabriolet members of the e-class family. new additions include powerful and efficient bluedirect four-cylinder engines featuring pioneering injection technology and trend-setting assistance systems, which come under the heading “intelligent drive”. these are systems which can help to prevent accidents with crossing vehicles or pedestrians, active lane keeping assist or anti-glare, permanent high-beam headlamps, for example. visually, both the coupé and cabriolet draw on the new mercedes-benz design idiom. exclusive, luxurious equipment for sublime refinement underlines the close affinity with the e-class family.
