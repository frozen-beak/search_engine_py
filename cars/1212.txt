back in black, mercedes-amg unveil their w14 formula 1 car ready for the 2023 season. the choice to go back to a black livery, which the team used for the 2020 and 2021 seasons, was done in the name of weight savings according to team officials. since the carbon fibre body panels are black in material, not having to paint those surfaces can save a few hundred grams of weight which can then be utilised better elsewhere. this is an important aspect to the ground effect cars as all through the 2022 season weight was a big issue for most teams, with many opting to remove paint from their cars throughout the season.
2022 was a difficult year for mercedes, who finished third in the constructor’s championship and failed for the first time in 8 years to finish first. third may not seem like such a bad result, but after such an extended time at the top, merecedes has very high expectations and the w13 was a troublesome car on many levels. now the w14 is here, and the world waits to see if mercedes have re-grouped enough to challenge for top honours once again.
