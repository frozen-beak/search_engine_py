the audi r8 lmx offers breathtaking performance and groundbreaking technology. the limited-edition car is the first production car in the world to come equipped with laser high beams. the r8 lmx will debut on the streets in the summer of 2014.
“audi has long dominated the most important 24-hour race. in addition to the outstanding tdi drive technology, a maximum light yield gives our pilots a major advantage, and with night racing in particular is a key factor to our success,” says prof. dr. ulrich hackenberg. “the transfer of the laser headlight to the audi r8 lmx underscores our leading position in lighting technology. the safety benefit this provides to the customer truly represents vorsprung durch technik,” says audi ag’s board member for development.
