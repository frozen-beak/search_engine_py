third generation bmw x5 m has arrived bigger and faster for 2020 with the new competition package. sharing the same 4.4l twin turbocharged v8 as the m5 competition, the x5 m competition is good for 625 ps (460 kw) of power at 6,000 rpm, and 553 lb-ft (750 nm) of torque between 1,800 and 5,600 rpm. this engine uses the hot-v configuration which has become common place amongst the german luxury vehicle makers. this allows for a smoother flow of the exhaust gases, spinning up the turbos much faster than traditional twin turbocharged setups.
design wise the x5 m competition features many of the m division styling cues seen across the range, including the quad round exhaust tips and large open air intakes in the front bumper. the wheels come in 21 and 22-inch sizes. overall the look has a somewhat toned down appearance when compared to the usual m car look, with fewer add-on elements producing a cleaner design.
