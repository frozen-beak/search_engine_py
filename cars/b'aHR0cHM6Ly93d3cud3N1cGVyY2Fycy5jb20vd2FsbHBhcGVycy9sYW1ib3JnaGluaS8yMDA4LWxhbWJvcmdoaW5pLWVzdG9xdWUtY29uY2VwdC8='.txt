it is a lamborghini like no other before it: a four-door sports car that sticks resolutely to its creed. the lamborghini estoque concept has everything that defines a lamborghini: extreme, uncompromising and unmistakably italian, iit brings a whole new versatility to the brand’s dna – with its four seats and ample luggage space, this “everyday sports car” is a perfect fit for an equally versatile lifestyle.
estoque is a study, a concept created specifically for the 2008 salon d’automobiles in paris. from the very first glance there can be no doubt that this is a lamborghini – a car with compelling presence, both unique and unmistakable. the long wheelbase, the low profile, the broad track, the mighty, accentuated wheels, the clean surfaces and razor-sharp definition – every single line breathes the spirit of the lamborghini brand.
