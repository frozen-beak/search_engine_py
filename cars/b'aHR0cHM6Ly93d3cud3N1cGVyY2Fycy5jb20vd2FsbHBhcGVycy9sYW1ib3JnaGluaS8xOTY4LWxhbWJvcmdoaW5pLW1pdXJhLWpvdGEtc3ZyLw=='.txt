automotive engineer and mechanic bob wallace was lamborghini’s factory test driver during the reign of the beautiful miura. story has it that bob pleaded lamborghini to build a race going version of the miura, a request that was turned down by the italian manufacturer who was against any form of motorsport at the time.
with the company unwilling, bob wallace went on to build it anyway in his spare time. born was the miura jota svr. the race ready car had a weight of only 800 kilograms and a version of the miura v12 pumping out 60 hp more than any other at 440 hp.
then ending for the jota was a sad one, with a mechanic crashing the car whilst trying to impress his girlfriend. the car was totalled and consumed by fire, destroying the only example ever made. later on ferrucio lamborghini prevented any other hard core miura being constructed, and would only allow for seven other models to be upgraded with j-spec performance parts.
the car pictured here is a faithful re-creation of the original miura jota svr.
