the introduction of the 2005 porsche 911 carrera and the 2005 porsche 911 carrera s marks the first time since 1977 that porsche powers the 911 with a pair of engines. the 2005 porsche 911 carrera is propelled by a 3.6-liter flat six-cylinder engine with 325 (sae) horsepower and 273 poundfeet of torque (370 newton meters) while the 2005 porsche 911 carrera s draws on a 3.8-liter flat six that provides 355 (sae) horsepower and 295 pound-feet (400 nm) of torque.
the first porsche to wear an “s” badge was the 1952 356 equipped with the 1.5-liter “super” engine. perhaps the most famous “s” model in the company’s history was the 911 s launched in 1967, though modern porsche enthusiasts might tell you their favorite is the 911 carrera 4s. in recent years, porsche has offered higher-performance models of the boxster roadster and cayenne sport utility vehicle designated as the boxster s and cayenne s.
the larger and more powerful new 3.8-liter engine is only one of several features that distinguish the 2005 porsche 911 carrera s, which also comes with, as standard equipment, the new porsche active suspension management technology, larger brakes with red-painted calipers, larger wheels, bi-xenon headlights, a sports steering wheel, aluminum-look interior trim and a silver-colored rear deck lid logo.
