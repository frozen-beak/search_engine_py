the 928 gts came for sale in late 1991 as a 1992 model in europe and in spring of 1992 as an early 1993 model in north america. changed bodywork, larger front brakes and a new, more powerful 5.4l, 350 ps (257 kw/345 hp) engine were the big advertised changes; what porsche wasn’t advertising was the price. loaded gts models could eclipse us$100,000 in 1995, making them among the most expensive cars on the road at the time. this severely hampered sales despite the model’s high competency and long standard equipment list. porsche discontinued the gts model that year after shipping only 77 of them to the united states. total worldwide production for all years was a little over 61,000 cars.
second-hand models’ value decreased as a result of generally high maintenance costs due largely to spare parts that are expensive to manufacture. the earliest versions, however, especially those models with the bosch k-jetronic (cis) injection system, have few electronic components and therefore can be repaired more easily provided spare parts can be found. parts suppliers supported by various enthusiasts exist especially in the united states.
the gts model has retained a high value however, and as of 2006 the price for all variants is apparently starting to creep upwards.
