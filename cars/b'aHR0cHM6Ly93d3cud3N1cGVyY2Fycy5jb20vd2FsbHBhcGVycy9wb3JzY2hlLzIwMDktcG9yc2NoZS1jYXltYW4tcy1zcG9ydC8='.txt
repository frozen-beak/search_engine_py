porsche cayman s sport, develops over 300 bhp from its tuned 3.4-litre flat-six engine and went on sale in autumn of 2008. originally launched in november 2005, the porsche cayman s quickly became the benchmark sports car in the coupe segment, a position it has held ever since.
the latest sport version combines the mid-engined dynamics of the porsche cayman s with the visual impact of the iconic 911 gt3 rs. in addition to a more powerful engine, the porsche cayman s sport offers a high level of sports driving features and a bespoke range of colour combinations.
the appearance of the porsche cayman s sport is striking, coming as standard in the 911 gt3 rs colours of orange or green and proudly bearing its model designation along its sides in black graphics. further colours available on this special model are black, guards red, speed yellow and carrara white, as well as arctic silver metallic.
with its black-painted alloy wheels, exterior mirrors and air intake grilles, the porsche cayman s sport proudly displays its sporting credentials, which are underlined by the black interior design package and a unique, circular instrument display without the usual binnacle above. the alcantara finish on the gear shift, the handbrake lever, and the rim of the steering wheel also creates a purposeful ambience.
