the launch of the new bmw m3 sedan and new bmw m4 coupe sees bmw m gmbh revealing a new interpretation of the high-performance sports car – and carrying the bmw m philosophy over into the fifth generation of the m3. more than 40,000 examples of the fourth-generation bmw m3 coupe were built, and now the bmw m4 coupe is poised to continue this success story. the “m4” badge is a reference to the model series that provides the basis for the new m model – and, for the first time, the coupe will be introduced at the same time as the four-door variant.
the high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with m twinpower turbo technology newly developed for the new bmw m3 sedan and new bmw m4 coupe produces a maximum output of 431 hp. its peak torque of 550 newton metres (406 lb-ft) is available across a wide rev band and outstrips the figure recorded by the outgoing bmw m3 by roughly 40 per cent. and yet the engine also achieves a reduction in fuel consumption and emissions of around 25 per cent. both the bmw m3 sedan and bmw m4 coupe cover the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h / 62 mph in 4.1 seconds (with the optional seven-speed m double clutch transmission).
in the interests of maximising dynamic ability and ensuring excellent efficiency, weight savings of around 80 kilograms have been achieved over a comparably equipped predecessor model. the bmw m4 coupe, for example, has a din kerb weight of 1,497 kilograms, thanks to the rigorous application of intelligent lightweight design measures. these include the increased use of lightweight materials such as carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (cfrp) and aluminium for a number of chassis and body components. indeed, both models feature a carbon roof.
