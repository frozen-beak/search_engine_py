the third body variant of the 992 generation porsche 911 has arrived, with the return of the classic 911 targa. the 911 targa is somewhat of a retro time warp in the 911 line-up. the iconic glass tonneau and roll hoop allow for the central roof section to be removed, providing an open air driving experience. targa tops have mostly disappeared in the automotive world, so it’s nice to see porsche retaining a bit of the past with their all new generation 911. and bonus points for looking better than the cabriolet 911.
like usual, the 911 targa will be available in both targa 4 and targa 4s all-wheel drive specs, but no rear-wheel drive option this time around. the 4s is the more powerful of the two, packing a hefty 450 ps (331 kw) punch of power, and 391 lb-ft (530 nm) of torque. the 4 is only a little bit behind with 385 ps (283 kw) of power on tap. both are equipped with porsche’s excellent eight-speed dual-clutch pdk transmission, with the option of selecting the seven-speed manual gearbox there as well.
visually the targa is suited to the wider stance of the 992 911, with the glass tonneau set further down the rear end than the cabriolet’s fabric roof. this helps remove the large bulbous rear end look that the cabriolet suffers from.
