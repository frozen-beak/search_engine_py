lamborghini teases a modern miura at the 2006 north american international auto show. the original miura was designed by marcello gandini and is considered one of the most beautiful cars ever made and commonly regarded as the world’s first supercar. this 2006 miura concept takes the same lovely form from the 1960’s and packages it into a modern supercar that fans can only dream of. and dream they will, as lamborghini have stated they have no intentions of putting this concept into production.
