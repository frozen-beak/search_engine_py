the 1996 celica for export market received the same front restyling as the japanese models, although the tail lights were untouched. the new front bumper has two smaller sections on each side of a smaller air dam as opposed to a single large air dam in previous models. also new were optional side skirts to improve its aerodynamic efficiency, as well as a redesigned rear spoiler. the north american gt and australian zr models came with standard fog lights, and the st and sx models without the optional fog lights had black grills fill in their place.
to celebrate 25 years of celica, the ss-i and ss-iii special edition were released in japan, and the 25th anniversary st limited and gt convertible marked this occasion in the us. these special edition models have special emblems on the front fenders, and the inside on the rear view mirror hanger, and the name celica was printed on the front seats as well.
