in may 1986, toyota was ready to release its next version of the supra. the bonds between the celica and the supra were cut; they were now two completely different models. the celica changed to front-wheel drive, utilizing the toyota “t” platform associated with the toyota corona, while the supra kept its rear-wheel-drive platform. the engine was updated to a more powerful 3.0l 200 hp (149 kw) inline 6. although only available in naturally aspirated trim in 1986.5, a turbocharged version of the engine was introduced in the 1987 model year. the supra was now related mechanically to the toyota soarer for the japanese market.
the third-generation supra represented a great deal of new technology. in 1986, options available for the supra included 3-channel abs and tems which gave the driver 2 settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at wot, hard braking, and high speed maneuvering. hks also made a “tems controller” to hack the system and activate it on the fly, though the controllers are now nearly impossible to find.
