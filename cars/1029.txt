the handsome bmw 8-series now has a soft-top convertible option, continuing the brands push into the luxury 2-seater market. the 8-series convertible is likely to slot in between it’s main rivals with a more aggressive and sporting setup than the mercedes s-class convertible, and a less intense experience of the porsche 911 cabriolet. bmw will look to find the niche of it’s new flagship model in this middle ground.
until the m8 models arrive, the top spec 8-series is the m850i xdrive which uses bmw’s 4.4l twin turbocharged v8. peak power is rated at 530 ps (380 kw) at 5,500 to 6,000 rpm, with maximum torque figure of 553 lb-ft (750 nm) available between 1,800 and 4,600 rpm. the 0-62 mph acceleration time is clocked at 3.9 seconds, 0.2 seconds slower than the 8-series coupe which shares the same powertrain.
