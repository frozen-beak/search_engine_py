before the new supra hits the market toyota have released the special edition toyota 86 hakone, named after the hakone turnpike in japan. that stretch of road is a privately owned toll road located in the mountains two hours southwest of tokyo. known for itâ€™s excellent surface quality and challenging layout, many enthusiasts and car reviewers have labeled it as japans best driving road.
so what does the hakone edition 86 include. on the outside toyota have fitted 17-inch twisted-spoke wheels finished in bronze, a black rear spoiler and a striking dark green paint colour called hakone green. for the inside special touches include black alcantara seats, a black sliding armrest with tan trim and black stitching. tan stitching also appears on the steering wheel, parking brake cover and shift boot, with black stitching on the door trim, knee pad and meter visor.
power from the 2.0l boxer engine remains the same with toyota refusing to entertain the cries of fans to provide a significant power bump for the 86. perhaps the next generation 86 will up the power game.
