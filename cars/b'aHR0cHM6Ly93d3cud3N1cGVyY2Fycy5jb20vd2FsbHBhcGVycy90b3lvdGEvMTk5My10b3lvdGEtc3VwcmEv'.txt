with performance equal or superior to many of the world’s most exotic sports cars, it would have been easy for toyota engineers to forget that supra is still a toyota at heart. but because it is a toyota, they were able to incorporate speed, style, quality, dependability and toyota’s legendary reliability.
supra is equipped with a sophisticated four-wheel fully independent suspension with coil-over shock absorbers with hollowed front and rear stabilizer bars for less weight. race-derived light-alloy double-wishbone suspension at all four wheels helps keep supra’s driver in control. this system provides a comfortable and balanced ride under all conditions.
