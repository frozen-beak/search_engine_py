huracan sto (super trofeo omologata) takes it’s place as the most extreme huracan road car lamborghini has created. set to take on the ever capable porsche 911 gt3 rs, the sto makes good use of lamborghini’s gt3 race car technology and applies it to a road going production car.
co-developed with the squada corsa motorsport division, the huracan sto focuses on weight reduction and aerodynamics in order to make the most of the naturally aspirated, mid-mounted v10 engine. producing 631 hp and 565 nm of torque, the sto has the same power and torque levels as the huracan evo, but with the gt3 race car’s throttle maps utilised to improve responsiveness across the rev range. acceleration for 0-62 mph is done and dusted in only 3.0 seconds flat, which is slightly slower than the evo due to the being rear-wheel drive.
