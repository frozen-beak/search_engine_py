twenty years ago, the audi avant rs2, founder of the dynamic rs family, had its debut – and now audi is launching a special edition of the current model on the market. the rs4 avant nogaro selection will become available from early 2014, and will celebrate its world premiere at the 2014 geneva motor show with nogaro blue paint finish and exclusive equipment.
the customized nogaro blue, pearl effect paint finish is the most salient visual signal of the anniversary model, and is also reminiscent of the rs2. the frame and use of the singleframe grille, as well as the window slot trims, are painted high-gloss black, and the roof rails matt black. the rs sport exhaust system terminates in two oval, high-gloss black tailpipe trims.
