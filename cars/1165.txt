amg purespeed concept provides a look at the first model in the highly limited mercedes-benz mythos series. in what is essentially a current gen sl without the roof and windscreen, mercedes will launch the real model in 2025 and limit production to just 250 units. unveiled in the run-up to the 2024 formula 1 monaco grand prix, the purespeed is a tribute to motor racing. it features a nod to the halo f1 cars have been using for several years now, with its very own halo like structure that connects the front to the rear as it overarches the middle of the cabin.
