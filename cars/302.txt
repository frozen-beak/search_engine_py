the all-new audi s6 sedan brings exhilarating performance, intelligent efficiency technologies and exclusive “s” design cues in a vehicle that builds upon the already excellent package delivered by its cousin, the audi a6, which was introduced in summer 2011.
the s6 is equipped with the new twin-turbo 4.0 tfsi engine that delivers 420 horsepower and an impressive 406 lb-ft of torque from 1,400 to 5,300 rpm. it accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 4.8 seconds and has an electronically governed top speed of 155 mph. the 4.0 tfsi v8 engine brings audi’s downsizing strategy of progressive performance to the mid-sized luxury sedan segment. compared to the engine in the previous model, the free-breathing 5.2-liter v10, it offers even sportier performance while reducing fuel consumption by as much as 25 percent.
