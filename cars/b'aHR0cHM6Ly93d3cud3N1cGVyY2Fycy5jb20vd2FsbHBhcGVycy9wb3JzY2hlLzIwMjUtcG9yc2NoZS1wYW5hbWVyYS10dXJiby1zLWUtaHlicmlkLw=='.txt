the turbo s e-hybrid is the most powerful panamera in the nameplate’s history, with over 770 hp from its hybrid powertrain. much like the turbo e-hybrid launched in the previous year, this s version utilises a 4.0l twin turbocharged v8 engine making 591 hp on its own and an electric motor integrated into the 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. that e-motor is good for 188 hp, and combine with the engine to produce a total system output of 771 hp. torque has also been increased, rising up to 738 lb-ft, and helping the turbo s e-hybrid accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and onwards to a top speed of 202 mph. it’s amazing that the 200 mph barrier was once only something a supercar could dream of crossing, now we have luxury gt cars up there too.
