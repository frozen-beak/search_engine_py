toyota are releasing a special edition of the gt86 dubbed the style cb, available for the japanese domestic market only. the toyota 86 style cb is instantly recognisable as an 86 from the back, with all the new styling elements focused at the front of the car. the headlights are now round with the front bumper replacing the sharp lines of the original for a sloped more rounded appearance. toyota say this new front end design was inspired by design house zagato.
the mechanicals stay the same, with the 2.0l boxer engine remaining at 200 ps and 151 lb-ft. the interior has gained some attention with beige and demitasse brown, two-tone color scheme available as well as single-tone silver, red, or black for the cabin. finishing off the interior is a new woodgrain surround for the stereo and cb badging on the leather steering wheel.
