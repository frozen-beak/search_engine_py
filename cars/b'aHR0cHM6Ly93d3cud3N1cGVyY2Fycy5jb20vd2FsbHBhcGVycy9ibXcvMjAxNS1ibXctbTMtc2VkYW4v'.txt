the launch of the new bmw m3 sedan and new bmw m4 coupe sees bmw m gmbh revealing a new interpretation of the high-performance sports car – and carrying the bmw m philosophy over into the fifth generation of the m3. more than 40,000 examples of the fourth-generation bmw m3 coupe were built, and now the bmw m4 coupe is poised to continue this success story. the “m4” badge is a reference to the model series that provides the basis for the new m model – and, for the first time, the coupe will be introduced at the same time as the four-door variant. logic dictates the latter will be christened the bmw m3 sedan.
“four generations of the bmw m3 have blended motor sport genes and uncompromised everyday usability within an emotionally rich overall concept,” explains dr friedrich nitschke, president bmw m gmbh. “the bmw m3 sedan and bmw m4 coupe represent an ongoing commitment to this philosophy. the engine is the heart of every m model, and the new turbocharged sixcylinder unit fitted in the two new cars combines the virtues of a high-revving naturally aspirated unit with the strengths of turbocharger technology. a committed lightweight design concept produces a weight saving of around 80 kilograms over the outgoing m3. the bmw m3 and bmw m4 take motor sport technology from the track to the road, and thousands of laps of the legendary nürburgring nordschleife – the world’s most exacting race track – have readied the new models for that transition. meticulous and passionfuelled development work has underpinned the creation of two highperformance sports cars that set new standards in terms of overall concept, precision and agility.”
