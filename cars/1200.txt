hot on the heels of the world premiere for the new mercedes-benz e-class, its first high-performance variant is on the way from mercedes-amg. the e43 4matic with the 3.0-litre v6 biturbo engine on board will represent the most powerful variant of the executive saloon when it is introduced in september 2016. with two new turbochargers and corresponding software applications, the supercharged six-cylinder engine delivers an output of 295 kw / 401 hp. as ever, the standard-specification amg performance 4matic four-wheel drive combines optimum traction with high agility on the e43, thanks to rear-biased torque distribution with a front-to-rear ratio of 31:69 percent. the 9g-tronic automatic transmission with shorter shift times, the retuned sports suspension based on the air body control air suspension and the more direct steering ratio also provide for signature amg driving performance.
the looks of the e43 4matic also render it immediately recognisable as a member of the amg family. apart from underscoring the powerful and self-assured appearance, three large openings in the front apron also ensure an optimum flow of air to the coolers. two elegant cross fins on the outer cooling openings enhance the vehicle’s visual presence. the diamond grille with chromed pins, a louvre in high-gloss black and the amg lettering represent further hallmarks of the amg 43 models.
