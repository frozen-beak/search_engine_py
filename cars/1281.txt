twelve cylinders, twin-turbocharging, 463 kw / 630 hp of output and 1000 newton metres of torque – the new mercedes-benz s65 amg sets new standards as the most powerful vehicle in its segment of the market. exceptional performance and outstanding dynamism – these are the hallmarks of the amg 6.0-litre v12 biturbo engine. with its reduced fuel consumption and compliance with the eu 6 exhaust emissions standard, the new v12 saloon is fit for the future. 
the amg sports suspension based on magic body control comes as standard with road surface scan, the world’s first suspension with eyes. it goes without saying that the s65 amg offers supreme exclusivity in design and equipment specification. two innovations, the head-up display and the touchpad, represent further enhancements in terms of comfort and safety.
the s65 amg is the only high-performance 12-cylinder automobile from a german premium manufacturer – and it is a car with a pedigree: the first generation of the mercedes-benz s65 amg was launched in 2003, with the second generation being produced from 2006 until 2013.
