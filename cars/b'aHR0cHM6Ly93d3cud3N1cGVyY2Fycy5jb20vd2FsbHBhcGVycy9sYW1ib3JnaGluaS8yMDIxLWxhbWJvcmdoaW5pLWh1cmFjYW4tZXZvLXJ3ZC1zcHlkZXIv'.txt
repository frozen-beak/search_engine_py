with the launch of the lamborghini huracan evo rwd spyder the evo line-up has been completed, with a coupe and spyder version for both the all-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive variants. the evo edition huracan’s have made a splash in the supercar world ever since they were first revealed in 2018. whilst the original huracan was quick, the evo took it to an all new level. a level that was settings track records around the world, and showing technical prowess where lamborghini hadn’t managed before.
as has been tradition at lamborghini since the gallardo, a rear-wheel drive model is released after the all-wheel drive model hits the market. so here we have the spyder version of the rear-wheel drive version of the evo version of the huracan. a car for those that like their cars driving the rear wheels only, with the wind in their hair whilst going fast.
