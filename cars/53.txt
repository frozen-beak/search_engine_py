the 2013 gallardo is based on the proven chassis and mechanical platform of its predecessor, but takes a significant step forward following extensive aerodynamic re-profiling of the surface geometries and the addition of adjustable aerodynamic devices, including an all-new ten-position rear wing. the net benefit of this significant aerodynamic upgrade is 120% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency over the gallardo’s 2012 model. with re-modelling of brake ducts, the new gallardo lp 570-4 super trofeo achieves a 50% improvement in thermal performance with improved front brake cooling, while better balance and dynamic performance is achieved by increasing downforce by 128kg in low downforce set up and 160kg in high downforce trim.
as automobili lamborghini looks to 2013 – its 50th anniversary year – super trofeo has grown into one of the company’s foremost platforms for communicating its brand heritage. having set out in 2009, the 2012 season has seen up to 20 cars contesting races at the best european tracks, featuring drivers from ten different nations and providing a level playing field in which no less than eight teams have shared the honours of claiming a pole position this season. 2,500 guests have been entertained in driving academies, passenger laps and parades or enjoyed the sumptuous and unique hospitality environment of the lamborghini village.
