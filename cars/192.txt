audi has finally launched it’s e-tron gt quattro electric sports car, which is set to compete with it’s ev rival the porsche taycan. the formula of the e-tron gt is similar to that of the taycan, with four doors in a coupe body style and enough room in the back for passengers. it also stands as audi’s first vehicle built from the ground up to be electric, as the e-tron suv, which was released in 2019, was a conversion of an existing platform designed for use with internal combustion engines.
the powertrain setup of the e-tron gt consists of two permanently excited electric motors placed on both the front and rear axles, with a two-speed transmission for the rear, and just the one ratio for the front. the battery runs on the same 800-volt system as the taycan and is 85 kwh in capacity, capable of 270 kw dc fast charging and rated for a wltp range of 303 miles. power from the two motors is rated at 469 hp with an overboost function that will add an extra 53 hp for 2.5 seconds, taking the peak power output to 522 hp with 465 lb-ft of torque. that overboost will activate under full throttle application, and helps the e-tron gt accelerate from 0-62 mph in 4.1 seconds and go onto a top speed of 152 mph.
