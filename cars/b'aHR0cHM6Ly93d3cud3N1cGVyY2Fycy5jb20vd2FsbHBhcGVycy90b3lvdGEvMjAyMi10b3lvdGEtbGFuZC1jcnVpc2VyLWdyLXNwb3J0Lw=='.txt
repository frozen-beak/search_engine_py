toyota’s gr branding has found it’s way to the all new land cruiser, the first new generation land cruiser in 14 years. the gr sport model takes it’s place as the sportier version in the new land cruiser line-up, with a different front grille, tweaked suspension and locking diffs.
the new chassis remains a body-on-frame setup, but now uses new production techniques for more refined welding and less metal overlap. weight has been reduced by around 440 pounds and torsional rigidity has increased by 20% thanks to aluminium doors, roof, front fenders, and hood. the air suspension from the previous generation has been removed, with toyota opting for a simpler setup of traditional coils and struts with revised geometry set to improve handling and off-road capability.
