the mercedes-benz “concept iaa” (intelligent aerodynamic automobile) is two cars in one: an aerodynamics world champion with a cd value of 0.19 and a four-door coupé embodying irresistible design. the study, which is celebrating its world premiere at the frankfurt international motor show, switches automatically from design mode to aerodynamic mode when the vehicle reaches a speed of 80 km/h, whereby numerous aerodynamics measures alter the shape of the vehicle. inside, the “concept iaa” continues the design line of the s-class and s-class coupé, offers new touch-based functions and provides an idea of what the interior of a business saloon might look like in the near future.
