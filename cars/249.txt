the second edition of the r8 e-tron, audi has taken the all new r8 and had another go at electrifying it. unfortunately audi has decided not to build the e-tron, with hope it may happen at a later date.
the electric range is quoted at 450 kilometers, with a energy density of 154 wh/kg and a low drag coefficient. the system is able to regenerate energy through harvesting  from the brakes.
in the end the r8 e-tron remains a rolling tech laboratory for audi into the eventual move to full electric vehicles.
