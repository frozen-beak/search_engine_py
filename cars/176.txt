a design with dynamic elegance and the latest high end technologies: the audi prologue avant show car with its stretched roof which the brand is presenting at the 2015 geneva motor show gives a look into the future – with the new and emotion filled design language that audi has initiated with its study in the coupe, the prologue.
in november 2014 at the los angeles motorshow, audi presented the audi prologue concept car, giving a look to the brand’s future design language. only four months later, the premium manufacturer is showing a variant of its visionary concept at the geneva motor show. the audi prologue avant combines dynamics, form and function in a perfect synthesis. with a length of 5.11 meters (16.8 ft) and a width of 1.97 meters (6.5 ft), the five-door car with its pioneering body concept positions itself clearly in the luxury class. at the same time, it offers unmistakeable sportiness and variability. technology is becoming an experience, both outside and inside: the driver and up to three passengers can enjoy a luxurious interior and are digitally connected thanks to a state‑of‑the‑art infotainment architecture and connect technology.
