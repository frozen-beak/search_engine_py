the third generation of the bmw m3, this time based on the e46 model series coupé, made its debut in the year 2000. and once again, the third edition of this world-famous sports car from munich excelled from the start through even more performance, more dynamism and even more unique design, clearly setting this special model apart from the other versions of the bmw 3-series.
a year after introducing the bmw m3 coupé, bmw m gmbh proudly presented the convertible version of the m3 based on the e46 model series in 2001. while identical with the fixed-roof coupé all the way back to the a-pillar, the convertible is nevertheless a very unique car, the striking waistline and the special character of an open-air sports car giving the convertible an even wider and more powerful look. in all, therefore, the bmw m3 convertible looks even more muscular and lower than its fixed-roof counterpart with which it naturally shares all technical highlights and refinements.
