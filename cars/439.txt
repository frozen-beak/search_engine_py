the weissach package 918 delivers what porsche calls “a more performance-oriented finish” to the 918 spyder. this performance finish is seen through elements like the unpainted roof, rear wing and windscreen frame, that all show the carbon weave usually covered over. most noticeable are the optional exterior sticker packs that all take inspiration from classic porsche 917 racer cars. these include the 1970 le mans-winning porsche salzburg 917, the iconic martini livery, or a more modern matte black or white finish.
the performance of the hybrid v8 setup remains the same, as does the electric motors, battery pack and pdk transmission. instead all the performance increases for the weissach package come in the form of reduced weight. a total of 41 kilograms have been stripped from the 918 spyder through the use of magnesium wheels and a severe reduction in cabin sound insulation. the interior gets six-point seat belts to make the driver feel more like a racer.
the 918s record braking run of 6 minutes 57 seconds around the nurburgring nordschleife was achieved in a weissach package 918, which was 3 seconds faster than the regular 918 spyder. demonstrating the benefits of weight reduction around a track. with a hefty price tag for the weissach package of £60,000 around 25 per cent of 918 buyers have chosen to tick the box, making sure they have the chance to experience the ultimate porsche.
