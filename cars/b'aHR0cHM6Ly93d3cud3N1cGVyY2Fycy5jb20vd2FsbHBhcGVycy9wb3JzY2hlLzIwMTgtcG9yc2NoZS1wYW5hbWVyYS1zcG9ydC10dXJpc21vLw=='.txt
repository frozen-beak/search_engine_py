after teasing us with the panamera sport turismo concept back in 2012, porsche has finally come good delivering a striking new look to the rear profile of the newly refreshed panamera. the sport turismo version will be available in all the current trim levels with panamera 4, panamera 4s, panamera 4s diesel, panamera 4 e-hybrid and panamera turbo. the turbo model will be the highest spec with 550 hp of power and 770 nm of torque.
the rear seats have been changed and can now seat 3 people for the first time, with an option to keep just the 2 rear seats is available as well. another unique feature of the sport turismo is the extendible roof spoiler that deploys to aid in handling and downforce up to speeds of 170 kph.
“for porsche, the panamera sport turismo is a step forwards into a new segment, but retains all of those values and attributes that are characteristic of porsche”, says michael mauer, director of style porsche.
