porsche’s new generation of 911 has finally revealed the turbo model, the very fast and capable everyday supercar. known for it’s effortless performance, the 2020 edition of the 911 turbo has received a new engine which ups the specs from the last gen car. power has risen 70 ps to 650 ps (478 kw) from the 3.8l twin turbocharged 6 cylinder engine. torque has also risen to a new high of 590 lb-ft (800 nm), which is available from 2,500 to 4,500 rpm.
that extra oomph it thanks to a lot of upgrades with the new engine. the variable geometry twin turbochargers have been mounted in a symmetrical layout with larger turbines and compressor wheels. a larger charge cooler has been fitted to the charge air cooling system and the air intake system has been redesigned for increased flow. porsche’s wonderful eight-speed pdk transmission has the job of shifting through the gears, and porsche’s traction management system has been improved to deliver torque to all four wheel more efficiently.
