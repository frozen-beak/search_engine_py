dynamics in a new top form – audi has honed the rs7 sportback. the large five-door coupe comes with new led headlights and even more enhanced infotainment features. with 412 kw / 560 hp and 700 nm / 516.3 lb-ft of torque, its 4.0 tfsi engine provides for an impressive driving performance.
“the audi rs7 sportback confirms the reputation of the rs models as the superior, top athletes of our brand,” states prof. dr. ulrich hackenberg, member of the board of management for technical development of audi ag. “the combination of a powerful four-liter v8 engine with cylinder on demand technology, quattro drive and intelligent lightweight design makes the rs7 sportback an outstanding piece of sports equipment for any fan of dynamic and yet efficient driving.”
even at first glance, the audi rs7 sportback reveals its dynamic character – the long engine hood, the sporty and flowing c pillars and the sharply sloping rear end form an aesthetic overall impression. new design details add striking touches. they include the singleframe grille with the black honeycomb typical of rs models, with the corners now even sharper and more distinctive. three optional packages – matt aluminum, gloss black and carbon – make the look of the rs7 sportback even more distinctive. the central front air inlet bears the quattro lettering. slight modifications have also been made to the bumper, with its distinctive air inlets.
