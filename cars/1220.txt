2015 marks the beginning of an evolutionary process for the cutting-edge hybrid racing formula introduced for 2014. but the word evolution shouldn’t mask the scale of the change this represents: the regulatory requirements and opportunities, coupled with ambitious internal performance targets, mean that this winter has been as challenging as ever. the more stable the rules, the more innovative a team must become to deliver performance from each generation of racing machine.
“from outside, winter might look like a rest time in formula one. but this couldn’t be further from the truth”, explains toto wolff, head of mercedes-benz motorsport. “long before the end of last season, development work on our 2015 car became the main priority. the winter months are the most intense, with everybody at brackley and brixworth working around the clock to prepare for the season ahead. their dedication is inspiring. it would be so dangerous to rest on our laurels after 2014 – but none of us have any sense that things will be easier now. on the contrary, our motivation is as high as ever. there’s a famous babe ruth quote i always say to people: “yesterday’s home runs don’t win today’s games”. we are fully aware that success is not only hard won but can also be short-lived without the right approach.
