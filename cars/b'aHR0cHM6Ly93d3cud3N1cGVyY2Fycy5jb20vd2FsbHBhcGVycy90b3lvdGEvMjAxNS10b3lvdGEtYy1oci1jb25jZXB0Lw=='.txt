inspired by the warm welcome that the first toyota c-hr concept vehicle received when it premiered at the 2014 paris motor show, designers have created a second c-hr concept. boasting a 5-door cabin, this new design study is more closely representative of the compact crossover which is now confirmed for production. its more refined execution is designed to gage reactions from specific target customer groups, in order that their feedback may further inform the project designers and engineers.
this highly-innovative design study for a stylish, lightweight and dynamic hybrid crossover is designed to stand out in an increasingly homogenous market place. it is the next rendition of akio toyoda’s promise, on taking over the presidency of toyota, to build always better cars that bring the fun back to driving.
its compact proportions placing it between the b-suv and c-suv segments, the toyota c-hr concept offers the combination of outstanding agility and flexible packaging, both essential to those with urban lifestyles.
it has been designed around a new platform, developed under the tnga (toyota new global architecture) programme, to satisfy customers’ demands for state of the art handling and controllability. in conjunction, a new, advanced, full-hybrid powertrain offers a uniquely engaging driving experience matched to 21st century traffic conditions, whilst delivering outstanding efficiency.
