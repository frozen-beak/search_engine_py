bmw have finally revealed the m8, the long awaited m car from bmw that now stands as the brands most powerful production car ever. bmw was close to bringing the m badge to the original 8-series in the 90â€™s, but unfortunately decided against the idea. now with the 8-series introduced in 2018, bmw have gone all the way in creating a proper performance version of their top of the line model.
the engine is the same found in the m5 competition, but tweaked to develop a bit more power. 625 ps (460 kw) of power and 553 lb-ft (750 nm) of torque are the numbers, which should result in the 0-62 mph dash completed in just 3.2 seconds. 0-124 mph will be over in 10.6 seconds and the m8 competition will go onwards to a top speed of 189 mph. a lot of the performance goodies in the m8 competition have been taken from the m5 competition, a car that has been praised as both very quick, and highly competent.
