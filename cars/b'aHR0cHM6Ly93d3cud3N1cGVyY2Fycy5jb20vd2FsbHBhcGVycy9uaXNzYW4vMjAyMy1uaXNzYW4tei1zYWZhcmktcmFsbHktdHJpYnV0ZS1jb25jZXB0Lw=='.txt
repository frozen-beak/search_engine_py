2023 is the year of the off-road sports car as nissan joins in on the fun with the z safari rally tribute concept. unfortunately, this is a one-off rather than a series production car as it pays tribute to the datsun 240z that won the 1971 east african safari rally. 
changes include a red & black livery, extra light pods mounted on the hood, front lip and a-pillars, and new 17-inch wheel designs with chunky, high sided yokohama geolander m/t tyres. the ride height has been raised by 2 inches with custom kw safari coilovers fitted, and a front guard and skid plate. the 3.0l twin turbocharged v6 gets treated to a little more power thanks to the addition of a cold-air intake, nismo exhaust and a software tune by ams.
