the new audi r8 lms is lighter and safer than ever before. it features even more race car technology, clearly improved aerodynamics and, as a result, provides customers with an efficient concept.
audi uses production parts in the new audi r8 lms whenever this makes sense in racing from a technical and economic point of view. for example, the v10 engine with 5.2 liters of displacement and a power output of up to 430 kw / 585 hp leaves the same line as the production unit. it remains nearly unchanged and, with a scheduled rebuild interval of 20,000 kilometers, stets standards in racing. the engineers use modified or completely new assemblies whenever this is required in racing by the regulations or by the clearly higher loads that occur in competitive conditions.
the new aerodynamic concept of the audi r8 lms for the first time includes a fully lined underfloor and a conceptually integrated rear diffusor. as a result, the dimensions of the rear wing can be reduced without a corresponding increase of aerodynamic drag. the wheel wells, which are open rearwards via a larger cross-section, contribute to improved airflow.
