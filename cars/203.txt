audi sq5 gets it’s mid-life refresh with tweaked styling and more driver assistance features. the styling changes are subtle but bring the q5 into line with the rest of the audi range, and brings a more refined appearance. the driver assist features are varied ranging from blind spot monitoring to audi pre sense rear, which detects any impending rear-end collision using radar sensors and can initiate preventative measures.
the 3.0l turbocharged v6 engine has remained with 349 hp and 500 nm of torque, connected to an eight-speed tiptronic transmission. the 0-60 mph acceleration time has been reduced by 0.4 seconds from 5.1 to 4.7 seconds for the revised model, which is a rather impressive feat considering power and torque has remained the same. the key comes in the form of the recalibrated transmission with new gear ratios and axle drive ratio, as well as a new launch control system.
