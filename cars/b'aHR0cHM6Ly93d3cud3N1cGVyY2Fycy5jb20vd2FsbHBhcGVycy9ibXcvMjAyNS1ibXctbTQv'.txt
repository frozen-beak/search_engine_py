bmw’s m4 line-up has just been refreshed with revised styling and more power for the all-wheel drive competition models. whilst the standard m4 and m4 competition (rwd) are left with the same amount of power as before, the awd competition coupe and convertible both get a 20 hp boost in peak power output. transmission choices remain the same with the regular m4 offered with a manual only, and the competition as an automatic only.
the styling changes are subtle with the front gaining redesigned led headlights and a tweaked bumper design. the rear taillights now come equipped with bmw’s laser light technology, and buyers will have the option of fitting m design graphics on the hood and trunk lid.
