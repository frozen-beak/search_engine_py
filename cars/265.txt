with a racing version of the new audi rs3 that made its world debut at the 2016 paris motor show, audi sport customer racing will extend its offering in customer sport starting in the 2017 season. the tcr version of the audi rs3 sedan puts customer sport at audi on an even broader base.
“audi has been active in motorsport on the highest level for generations,” says stephan winkelmann, managing director at audi sport with responsibility for the audi r and rs models which audi sells under the “audi sport” label. “with the audi r8 lms, audi sport customer racing, in a very short time, managed to build a successful customer sport program alongside the factory commitments in the wec and the dtm. the audi r8 lms has since become the market leader in its segment. we have the same plans for the audi rs3 lms, which offers customers an attractive opportunity to get started in fascinating audi racing.”
the audi rs3 lms is being developed by audi sport customer racing for the tcr category which is still relatively new. in addition to an international tcr series, with some of its races being held as part of the fia formula one world championship supporting program, more and more national racing series for tcr touring cars are being founded. even major endurance events such as the 24 hours of nürburgring are now including tcr classes.
