only a g-class can be better than a g-class. this is the credo followed by the developers with the mercedes-benz g63 amg 6×6, and they are now stepping up a gear with the g500 4×4². the basic recipe for this overcomer of everything is simple: take the superior all-wheel-drive powertrain including portal axles from the 6×6 – take away one axle – and blend it all with a newly-developed variable chassis and the series-production g-class body. a large pinch of v8 power with 310 kw / 422 hp, a set of 22-inch 325/55 r 22-sized wheels, carbon-fibre body parts and then just gourmet ingredients from the seductive designo exclusive range for the interior – and the 5-star menu for all off-road enthusiasts is ready.
a new addition to the extreme g-class model family: the g63 amg 6×6 has a model brother in the form of the g500 4×4². the near-series show car is a new highlight in the superlative-rich history of the g-class and blends all the advantages of the model series. the series-production models of the g-class supply the unshakeable foundations in the form of the body and ladder-type frame, which compensate for the considerably increased performance of the g500 4×4² without any problem and also without any type of reinforcements. the g63 amg 6×6 donates an amended version of the ruggedly determined permanent all-wheel-drive powertrain with portal axles. the engine compartment houses a completely new v8 engine with a displacement of four litres, direct injection and biturbocharging. also new is the chassis with dual spring/damper struts and adjustable damping.
