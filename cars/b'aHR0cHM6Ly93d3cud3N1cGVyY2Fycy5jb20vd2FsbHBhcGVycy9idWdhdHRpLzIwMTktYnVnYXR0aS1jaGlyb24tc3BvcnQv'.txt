bugatti’s insane chiron now has a sport version that has put the hyper car on a carbon fiber diet, increasing the capabilities of an already out of this world performance car. power from the 16 cylinder engine remains the same, which means the chiron sport is not the rumored 300 mph+ super sport version people were hoping for. perhaps bugatti is leaving that ace up their sleeve for later.
mechanical changes includes a rear differential setting that enables all new dynamic torque vectoring to help the chiron handle all those horsepowers. the suspension now has a firmer set-up when activated in the car’s ‘handling’ mode. and the centrally mounted quad-pipe exhaust outlet is new. weight saving come from lighter wheels, carbon fiber windscreen wipers and a new engine compartment window. the combined reduction in weight is around 18 kilograms, which in the end isn’t much for a car that weighs nearly 2 tonne anyway. the 0-100 kph time is still listed at under 2.5 seconds, with 0-200 kph coming in under 6.5 seconds. finally the top speed remains limited to 261 mph.
