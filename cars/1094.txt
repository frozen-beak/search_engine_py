for the first time, bmw have produced a competition m model for their two mid range sport utility and activity models. these m models come in two different flavours for both the x3 and x4. first is the regular x3 m and x4 m, both of which are powered by an all-new 3.0l straight 6 twin turbo engine, producing 480 ps (353 kw) of power. not content with those numbers, bmw are launching right along side a ‘competition’ version. these models get a power bump, with peak power raised to 510 ps (375 kw) at 6,250 rpm, and peak torque coming in at 442 lb-ft (600 nm) between 2,600 and 5,950 rpm.
the new bmw x3 m competition seems to be the pick of the two, with handsome looks minus the impractical elements of the x4. the m model treatment comes with the usual bmw visual flair including larger air dams and grills, big wheels and blacked out aero elements on the bodywork. with the power boost and increased capabilities, the x3 m competition is set to rival the likes of the mercedes-amg glc 63 s and alfa romeo stelvio quadrifoglio.
