with its new top model in the gran turismo model line, porsche is raising the bar for sporty four-door cars in the luxury class by yet another notch. the new porsche panamera turbo s is a unique combination of performance and efficiency, driving dynamics and comfort. despite the increased power and higher torque, fuel consumption values remain at the moderate level of the panamera turbo – yet another example of “porsche intelligent performance”.
even for a top luxury class model, porsche’s new top-of-the-range panamera boasts an extraordinarily comprehensive equipment level. for example, in keeping with the high performance panamera’s sporty concept, it features the sports exhaust system as standard for an even more emotional engine sound as well as every driving dynamics control system that there is for the gran turismo. porsche dynamic chassis control (pdcc), an active rollstabilisation system, nips in the bud the vehicle’s tendency to lean when cornering, thus enhancing agility and comfort in equal measure. porsche torque vectoring plus (ptv plus) applies a variable torque split to the rear wheels combined with an electronically controlled rear differential lock, thus ensuring superior traction in every driving situation. the steering system uses the speed-dependent servotronic. it goes without saying that the suspension of the panamera turbo s features the porsche active suspension management (pasm) adaptive damper control and adaptive air suspension with additional air volume.
