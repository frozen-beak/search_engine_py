lamborghini have expanded the huracan evo family with a simplified rear-wheel drive model, focused on a more engaging driving experience. the advantages of going 2-wheel drive can be seen with the weight reduction of 33 kilograms, and removal of the some of the electronic driver aids which should provide a more pure driving challenge. the downside comes with decreased performance, as the 5.2l v10 engine has been detuned down to 610 ps (449 kw) of power and 416 lb-ft (560 nm) of torque. this all results in a 0-62 mph sprint of 3.3 seconds, a full 0.4 seconds slower than the all-wheel drive huracan evo.
this isn’t the first time lamborghini have gone down this path, with various huracan models receiving the rear-wheel drive treatment. in fact it all started with the gallardo balboni in 2009, which was produced to honour the factories long standing test driver valentino balboni. with the world turning to forced induction and electrified powertrains, it’s refreshing to see lamborghini still producing simple rear-wheel drive, naturally aspirated supercars that let the driver to most of the work.
