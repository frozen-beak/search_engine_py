the mercedes-benz 300 sl was conceived initially as a purpose-built racing sports car (w 194). in 1952, the coupe notched up an impressive record of success in the year’s major races. at the grand prix in bern the 300 sl sealed a clean sweep of the podium places, an awesome performance backed up by a one-two finish ahead of a stunned field in the 24 hours of le mans. it all added up to a majestic return to motor sport for mercedes-benz, picking up where the brand had left off during a highly successful period before the second world war.
the body of the mercedes-benz 300 sl gullwing was developed with the primary aim of cutting aerodynamic drag to a minimum. the result was a streamlined form with few adornments, a car which adhered faithfully to its design brief and which has retained its freshness and allure to the present day. wonderfully proportioned and extremely dynamic, it was as if the 300 sl – surging forward on its wheels – had been cut form a single mold.
the new sports car was a real crowd-puller, thanks in no small measure to its wonderfully charismatic “gullwing” doors. rather than serving merely as a stylistic gimmick, they represented the central element of the 300 sl design, the ultimate example of necessity as the mother of invention. the car’s aluminum skin was stretched over a tubular frame, which – in the interests of stability – rose much further than usual up the sides of the vehicle, making it impossible to fit conventional doors. the response of the engineers was to devise an upwards-opening door concept. the elegance of the car’s side view remained undisturbed by a door handle, with a discreet pull-out bar disengaging the lock. the door then opened upwards with the help of a telescopic spring.
