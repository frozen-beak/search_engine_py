for the first time the mercedes-amg gla45 is getting the full s treatment, making it a very capable 400 horsepower all-wheel drive compact suv. available in both s and non s versions, the gla45 uses the same engine configuration as the current a45 with matching power and torque figures. that means 415 hp of power and 500 nm of torque. class leading specs from the worlds most powerful production 4 cylinder engine at the time of writing.
owners of the gla45 s will enjoy brisk performance with 0-62 mph over in 4.3 seconds, and a top speed of 168 mph. mercedes 4matic+ all-wheel-drive system will help keep everything in check and provide plenty of grip, whilst the 360mm six-piston brakes should help with stopping power. an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission has been fitted to shift through the gears, and large 20-inch wheels help fill out the wheel arches of the slightly higher riding gla.
