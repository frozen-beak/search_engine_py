the gallardo spyder is not just an open-top version of the coupé, but is a completely new model. it has an attractive new design and a unique system for opening and closing the fabric roof that utilises the engine compartment to store the folded roof.
the lamborghini centro stile and engineers from the research and development team have worked in close partnership to develop this new design and to bring these clean and sharp lines on the road.
the new lamborghini gallardo spyder features a number of important modifications to the original engine and transmission from the coupé. the 10-cylinder 4961 cc propulsion unit now develops 520 ps (382 kw) at 8,000 rpm. the six-speed gearbox now has lower ratios (1st gear is 27% lower, 2nd gear is 13%, 3rd / 4th / 5th gears are all 6% lower, while 6th gear is 3.5% lower), which create a more dynamic performance. finally, its performance figures: the gallardo spyder – which complies with euro 4 homologation standards – reaches a top speed of 314 km/h with the roof up and 307 km/h with the roof down, accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.3 seconds.
