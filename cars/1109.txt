pure impulse edition finally gives buyers a manual transmission option for the bmw z4. since the launch of the g29 generation z4, the choice of gearbox was limited to an automatic only. this was more in line with the more comfortable gt behaviour of the car that bmw opted for over a more sports car package. now with the pure impulse package, bmw are offering up revised chassis tuning along with the manual gearbox to hopefully provide a sharper, more involved driving experience.
