the new baby lamborghini has arrived, it’s a mid-engined v10, 2-door coupe with all-wheel drive, and it’s called the huracan. after a long and successful run with the first baby lambo, the gallardo, lamborghini have knocked it out the park yet again. the styling is perhaps the most important feature of any new lamborghini, and the huracan delivers in spades. it continues along the same forms as the aventador, with striking shapes carved out of the bodywork, and creases in all in the right spots. the proportions make the huracan seem aggressive, with a low stance that looks like it’s hungry to attack the road.
powering the whole show is the 5.2l v10, which delivers 610 ps (448 kw) of power and 413 lb-ft (560 nm) of torque. this is fed through a new 7-speed dual-clutch transmission called “lamborghini doppia frizione” (ldf), which sports three different dynamic systems; strada, sport and corsa. these modes change the characteristics of the cars behaviour on the road and track to the drivers desired effect. much like how ferrari have done for several years now, the huracan has this driver mode selector integrated on the steering wheel for quick and easy changes.
perhaps one of the most impressive stats for the new huracan is the 0-62 mph sprint time of 2.5 seconds. that’s some blistering acceleration right there that even outperforms the bigger, more powerful aventador by some margin. lastly the claimed top speed has managed to sneak over the 200 mph mark, cementing the huracan as a true entry into the supercar club.
