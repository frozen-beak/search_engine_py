the mercedes eqs stands at the precipice of launching the german brand into their electrified future, set to replace the symbol of mercedes-benz’s heritage, the s-class. while the s-class will remain will us for a while yet, there’s no doubt the eqs represents mercedes newest luxury flagship that demote the s-class to a legacy product.
available at launch with both a single and dual motor setup, the initial top spec eqs develops 516 hp and 630 lb-ft of torque. acceleration from 0-62 mph is done in 4.3 seconds which is a good number considering the hefty 5,699 lbs of weight the eqs has to lug around. impressively the eqs comes equipped with 107.8kwh of useable battery capacity that can be charged up speeds of 200 kw and should provide a driving range of around 477 miles.
due to being developed as an ev first, the eqs has different proportions to the s-class with shorter front and rear sections allowing more interior space. that interior features perhaps the biggest party piece of the eqs, a giant expanse of screen covering the entire dashboard. it consists of three different displays with the biggest one set in the center and the other two smaller ones set either side. it does look very impressive as all the displays blend into a single piece of glass with contoured edges that help mask the usual rectangle shapes of many infotainments setups.
