mercedes-amg is embarking on the 2012 roadster season in inimitably dynamic style: following on from the recent launch of the sl 63 amg, the top eight-cylinder model, there now comes the presentation of the new mercedes-benz sl 65 amg, the v12 roadster in the line-up from the stuttgart-based manufacturer. the amg 6.0-litre v12 “biturbo” (twin-turbocharged) engine develops a maximum output of 463 kw / 630 hp) and maximum torque of 1,000 newton metres. the result: exceptional performance, impressive power delivery and effortlessly superior dynamics. as with the sls amg super sports car, the use of an all-aluminium bodyshell results in a drastic reduction in weight. the new sl 65 amg is some 170 kilograms lighter than before. the expressive front section is dominated by the new “twin blade” radiator grille and the front apron’s lower cross strut in high-sheen chrome.
“the combination of exclusive v12 dynamic performance and a refined roadster driving experience was already the defining attribute of the predecessor model. we are convinced that, with the new sl 65 amg, we have developed an incomparably exciting high-performance vehicle for the small, but loyal community of fans”, says ola källenius, ceo of mercedes-amg gmbh.
