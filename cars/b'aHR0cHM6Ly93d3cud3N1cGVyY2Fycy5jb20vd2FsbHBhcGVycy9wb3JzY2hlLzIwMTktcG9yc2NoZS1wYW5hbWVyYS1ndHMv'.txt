the gts badge returns to the porsche panamera and the panamera sport turismo now joins in on the fun, ready for the 2019 model year. power from the 4.0l biturbo v8 peaks at 460 ps (338 kw) between 6,000 and 6,500 rpm, with 457 lb-ft (320 nm) of peak torque arriving between 1,800 and 4,500 rpm. for the two gts models the porsche sport chrono pack comes as standard, with both models utlising an all-wheel drive setup and an 8-speed pdk transmission.
2019 panamera gts is lowered by 10mm with three-chamber adaptive suspension and a more dynamic active suspension management (pasm) setup. brake discs come in at 390mm up front and 365mm at the rear. they sit behind a set of large 20-inch wheels. as is usual with the porsche gts models, the panamera gts makes use of a sport design package with black styling elements on the outside, with alcantara and aluminium highlights on the inside.
