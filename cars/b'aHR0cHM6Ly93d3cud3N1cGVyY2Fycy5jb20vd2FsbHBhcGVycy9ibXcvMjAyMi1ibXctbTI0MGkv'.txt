bmw have taken the wraps off their all new 2-series, with the m240i the range topper until the m2 arrives later. the big news with this new 2-series is bmw sticking to it’s tried and true formula of a small, rear-wheel-drive coupe powered by an internal combustion engine.
featuring a squared off, aggressive stance, the m240i bucks the latest bmw styling trend and sports a regular sized front grille. this will come as a relief to some, as it helps the 2-series greatly in the looks department.
sharing the familiar powertrains found in the 3-series line-up, the m240i gets the b58 3.0l inline 6 engine with a single turbo. peak power has been rated at 369 hp with 369 lb-ft of torque between 1,900 and 5,000 rpm. at launch an eight-speed zf-sourced automatic transmission is the only option for changing gears, and bmw’s rear-biased xdrive system is in play for the m240i making sure it has plenty of grip.
