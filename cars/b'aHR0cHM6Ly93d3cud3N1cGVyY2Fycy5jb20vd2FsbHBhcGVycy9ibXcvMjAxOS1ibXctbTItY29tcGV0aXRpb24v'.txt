since the m2 was released in 2016 it has been praised the world over, now bmw has given it the full beans with a 410 hp twin turbo engine from the m4 under the hood. the new m2 competition stands as perhaps what the original m2 should have been, the true spiritual successor to the bmw 2002 turbo, e30 m3 and 1m coupe. all featured the recipe of taking the guts of their larger performance brothers and stuffing it into a smaller lighter shell. the bmw m2 competition is poised to continue that tradition and cement its place amongst bmw royalty.
previously the m2 used the n55 engine that was a effectively a revised version of the engine from the m135i and used a single twin-scroll turbocharger. the 3.0l twin turbocharged straight 6 s55 engine from the m3 and m4 is tuned to produce peak horsepower of 410 between 5,250 and 7,000 rpm, and peak torque of 550 nm between 2,350 and 5,200 rpm. as a result 0-100 kph is now achieved in 4.2 seconds and the top speed is limited to 280 kph with the optional m driver’s package.
