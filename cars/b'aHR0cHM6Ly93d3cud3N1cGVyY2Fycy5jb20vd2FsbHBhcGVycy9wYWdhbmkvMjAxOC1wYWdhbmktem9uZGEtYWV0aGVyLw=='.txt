starting life as a zonda roadster f, this car was dubbed the zonda aether after going through the zonda 760 upgrade experience. it made it’s first public appearance at the 2018 pagani raduno, where onlookers were treated to it’s combination of gloss and satin finish bare carbon fiber bodywork. the exterior is adorned with red accent stripes throughout, including the main stripe down the centerline of the car and the down the length along the sides. the front headlights have a red stripe underneath, and the rear spoiler end plates, wheel center locks, brake calipers and various interior elements all get the red treatment as well.
mechanically the zonda aether has the full 760 upgrade package which includes new aero, roof scoop, inconel and titanium exhaust. the daytime running lights were left out. the engine was treated to a slightly more adventurous upgrade with peak power upped from 760 ps to 800 ps (588 kw) from the 7.3l v12 unit. not much more is known about the cars performance, but the aether sure does look worthy of it’s place among the many one-off zonda’s around the world.
