new bmw m135 has arrived with chassis, tech and design upgrades, but with a little less power as well. this makeover focuses more on sharper dynamics than bigger numbers on the spec sheet with the m135 losing about 6 hp and 37 lb-ft from the 2022 model. whilst that’s not a big difference, it is unusual to see a new car have less power than its predecessor.
to make up for it, bmw have fitted revised suspension, dampers, rolls bars, underbody bracing and a stiffer bodyshell for more precise handling. buyers can also spec more track focused tyres for even better handling abilities.
