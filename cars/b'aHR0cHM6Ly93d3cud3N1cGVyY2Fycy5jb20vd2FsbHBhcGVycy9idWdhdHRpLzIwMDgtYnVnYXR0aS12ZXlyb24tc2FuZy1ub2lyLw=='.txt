the bugatti veyron sang noir is a special edition, created for the true automotive connoisseur. while its entirely black exterior may initially appear subdued, upon closer inspection it becomes clear that a select number of visual accents make this special bugatti veyron just as vividly coloured as its brighter counterparts.
similar to its thoroughbred predecessor, the type 57s atlantic, the bugatti veyron sang noir exposes a raptor-like dna that is reflected throughout the entire model history of the marque. even the hand-stitched, all-leather interior of the bugatti veyron sang noir plays on the theme of a ‘harmony of extremes’. the light and confident tangerine is offset by a black-piano lacquer finished centre console; both available exclusively to this edition. a dominant black tinted carbon fibre monocoque joins the elegant black body sides, which in turn are complemented by polished details.
the face of the bugatti veyron sang noir is instantly recognisable due to the iconic horseshoe grill, finished exclusively in chrome. this striking and unparalleled harmony between luxury and sportiness is complemented by alloy-coloured details in the form of the chromed bugatti grill and door-mirrors, as well as polished wheel surfaces and roof-rails. all-black front lights, air intakes, filler caps and door-handles naturally heighten the stunning effect of the racing-blue brake callipers.
of the bugatti veyron sang noir 15 cars will be built and offered in europe, the middle east and the united states.
