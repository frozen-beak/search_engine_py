available only as a hatchback, the audi s3 was the more sporty version of the regular audi a3. the turbocharged 4 cylinder was capable of 165 kw (222 hp) and 280 nm (206 ft-lb) of torque, marking the first time a small 4 cylinder engine had been used in an audi s car.
while the s3 was all-wheel drive, it did not use audis quattro system. instead the haldex system from volkswagens parts bin was implemented. this meant the car was mostly front-wheel drive with the ability to adjust the bias of torque distribution from the front to the rear axle when required.
