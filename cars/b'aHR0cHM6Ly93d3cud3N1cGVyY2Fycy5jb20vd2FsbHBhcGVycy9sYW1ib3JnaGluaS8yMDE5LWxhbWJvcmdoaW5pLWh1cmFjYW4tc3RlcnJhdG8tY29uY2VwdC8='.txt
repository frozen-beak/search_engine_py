the lamborghini huracan sterrato concept shows off what lamborghini thinks an off-road mid-engined supercar would look like. with the introduction of the urus in 2018, lamborghini have already shown the world how a modern suv works lamborghini style. now they are giving a glimpse at a different take on off-roading with the huracan sterrato concept.
powered by the same v10 engine as the huracan evo, the sterrato has a few extra additions to helps those off-road ambitions. the under body has been toughened with aluminium skid plates to help survive passing over rocks, the ride height has been raised by 47mm and the bodywork has been widened with add-on wheel arch extensions, side sills and bumpers. new 20-inch wheels are adorned with larger tyres and reinforced sidewalls that stick slightly outside of the arches. additional lighting has been added on the front and rear, as well as a set of roof racks to complete the new off-road look for the huracan.
