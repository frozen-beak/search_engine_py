the new research vehicle f015 luxury in motion has its world premiere at the consumer electronics show, and provides a concrete example of the visionary ideas the company is developing with regard to autonomous driving of the future. with this self-driving luxury saloon mercedes-benz illustrates how the car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a private retreating space. this new way of travelling gives passengers the freedom to use their valuable time on the road in manifold ways.
progressing from the self-propelled (“automotive”) to the self-reliant (“autonomous”) vehicle, mercedes-benz as a pioneer goes far beyond the purely technical realisation of automated driving. the company’s experts also have to anticipate different outlooks and social trends. people are always at the centre of such considerations. just as the 1886 benz patent motor car and its successors revolutionised personal mobility and, as a consequence, society as a whole, the first self-driving cars will also bring about major changes.
“anyone who focuses solely on the technology has not yet grasped how autonomous driving will change our society. the car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space,” explains dr dieter zetsche, chairman of the board of management of daimler ag and head of mercedes-benz cars.
