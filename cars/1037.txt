bmw have shown off the slightly odd looking ivision dee concept which previews the design and tech of the brands upcoming ev models from 2025. revealed at the 2023 consumer electronics show (ces) in las vegas, the ivision dee will thankfully bear very little resemblance to the actual cars bmw will release from 2025. this concept previews the design language and technology that will be used.
this all signals the beginning of bmw’s neue klasse range of bespoke electric vehicles. this range will exist alongside bmw’s existing ice, hybrid and ev models with the intention of eventually replacing all-electric versions of current models.
