the toyota 2000gt is a limited-production, front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-seat, hardtop coupé grand tourer designed by toyota in collaboration with yamaha. first displayed to the public at the tokyo motor show in 1965, the 2000gt was manufactured under contract by yamaha between 1967 and 1970. in japan, it was exclusive to toyota’s japanese retail sales channel called toyota store.
the 2000gt revolutionized the automotive world’s view of japan. the 2000gt demonstrated that japanese auto manufacturers could produce a sports car to rival those of europe, in contrast to japan’s image at the time as a producer of imitative and stodgily practical vehicles. reviewing a pre-production 2000gt in 1967, road & track magazine summed up the car as “one of the most exciting and enjoyable cars we’ve driven”, and compared it favorably to the porsche 911. today, the 2000gt is seen as the first seriously collectible japanese car and the first “japanese supercar”. examples of the 2000gt have sold at auction for as much as us$375,000.
