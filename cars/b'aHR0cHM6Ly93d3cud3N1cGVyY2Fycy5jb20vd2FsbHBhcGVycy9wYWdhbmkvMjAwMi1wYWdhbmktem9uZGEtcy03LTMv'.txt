the zonda design is the creation of horacio pagani, and can be summed up as the result of the intense search for aerodynamic and ergonomic aesthetics indelibly linked to the need to create unforgettable emotions.
the zonda s introduces new styling with the addition of an elongated “nose”, a feature that was already present in the first designs that juan manuel fangio looked at back in 1988. at the back of the car a focal point is the original double airspoiler flanked by two aero flaps on the engine cover. these changes produce better aerodynamics over the whole vehicle and contribute to creating a strong visual impact. at the rear of the car new light clusters have been dynamically positioned and the new series of air intakes positioned around the four formidable exhaust pipess form an original cornice for this feature. one gets the general impression looking at the car of a leap forward in self-assertiveness echoed by the “jet” effect.
the dynamic personality of the zonda in all driving conditions make it a real object of pleasure to use. road stability is excellent and is made so by the first-rate suspension system and the rigid frame as well as the efficient aerodynamics of the body: at a speed of 200 km/h the downforce is equal to a load of 100kg at the front and 130kg at the rear. in normal driving conditions the zonda offers a comfortable and relaxed driving experience. but can, on command, become a true supercar, unleashing the driving spirit that’s in every sportscar enthusiast. this dual personality that is a feature of the zonda allows any driver the distinctive pleasure of an exceptional driving experience. the pitch of the zonda is clear, powerful, unforgettable: the sound of a champion.
