eight years after the launch of its sensationally popular roadster, porsche introduces the second generation of its sporty porsche boxster and even higher-performance porsche boxster s models. while this new pair of mid-engine porsches features evolutionary design changes, the delight of the restyling is in the details, and both cars benefit from revolutionary engineering and advanced technologies.
for the 2005 model year, engines are substantially more powerful, yet also more fuel efficient in both the porsche boxster and boxster s. new five- and six-speed manual transmissions feature shorter, crisper gear changes and tiptronic s gearboxes have been upgraded. variable-ratio steering is standard equipment, and the steering column both tilts and telescopes to enhance driver control and comfort. driver and passenger both benefit from redesigned and roomier interiors and four seating choices.
wheels and tires are larger and brakes are upgraded. porsche stability management becomes part of a long list of standard equipment, with porsche active suspension management, porsche composite ceramic brakes and the porsche sports chrono package added to the options list.
