many car enthusiasts already know that the “s” badge on a porsche signifies a truly special model, not just a trim upgrade. porsche first used the “s” badge in 1952 for a 356 model with a 1.5-liter engine. perhaps the most famous porsche “s” model arrived in 1967, the legendary 911 s. the porsche boxster s, introduced in model year 2000 takes its place among legendary porsche sportscars bearing that letter.
the porsche boxster s builds on the foundation of the wildly successful boxster model. as did classic porsche “s” models, the boxster s benefits from a comprehensive high-performance upgrade. compared to the standard boxster, the porsche boxster s features a larger, more powerful engine and a six-speed manual transmission in place of the five-speed. larger cross-drilled brake discs from the 911 carrera‚ provide additional stopping power.
a new center grill feeds an additional radiator needed for extra cooling capacity of its larger engine. all three front grills receive titanium-color center bars and trim. titanium color also marks the windshield frame and the rear window trim of the optional aluminum hardtop and highlights the “boxster s” nameplate on the rear trunklid. the porsche boxster s-specific 17-inch wheels clearly show off the distinctive red-painted brake calipers.
