audi has made its r8 high-performance sports car even more attractive and dynamic. the audi r8 v10 plus is a new top model in the model series, with a totally new 7-speed s tronic. the led headlights and the new rear indicator lights with dynamicized display are standard equipment on all variants.
the r8 embodies audi’s full expertise in ultra-lightweight design. the aluminum body with the audi space frame (asf) weighs only 210 kilograms (462.97 lb) on the coupé, and 216 kilograms (476.20 lb) on the spyder. the unladen audi r8 v8 coupé with manual transmission registers just 1,560 kilograms (3439.21 lb) on the scales, while the open-top sports car weighs 1,660 kilograms (3659.67 lb). the audi r8 v10 plus, available only as a coupé, brings the needle to 1,570 kilo­grams (3461.26 lb). adjustable bucket seats with glass fiber reinforced plastic (gfrp) chassis, less use of insulating materials, special light alloy wheels and chassis components, including the standard ceramic brakes, as well the cfrp add-on parts at the body all contribute to lowering the weight.
on the audi r8 spyder the lid on the soft top compartment and the side parts are also cfrp. the elegant, lightweight fabric top, with its largely aluminum and magnesium linkage, is the crowning touch to the ultra-lightweight design. the top opens and closes electrohydraulically in 19 seconds, and during driving at up to 50 km/h (31.07 mph). the heated window pane in the bulkhead between the passenger and engine compartments stands apart from the soft top; the window can be retracted and extended by a switch and also serves as a wind deflector. in case of a pending rollover, two strong, spring-tensioned sections shoot upwards from the seats.
