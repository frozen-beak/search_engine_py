bmw’s baby m car is now even more potent with more power, chassis upgrades and upgraded tech. whilst the visual facelift is mild, bmw have kept the best upgrades for the mechanical side of things. power has been raised by 20 hp to a new high of 473 hp, and the torque output has also risen by 37 lb-ft to a new peak of 443 lb-ft. bmw’s eight-speed m steptronic transmission comes as standard, but buyers will retain the option to fit a six-speed manual. the downside to the manual option is that the engine reverts back to its original torque output of 406 lb-ft.
