in 1981, it appeared that new le mans regulations would allow a 917 to race again. the kremer racing team entered a homebuilt updated 917, the 917 k-81. the car raced at le mans qualifying in the top 10 but retired after seven hours after a collision with a back marker led to a loss of oil and withdrawal.
the final chapter though was to be at brands hatch where the car ran in the 6 hours at the end of the season. the car was competitive and ran at or near the front, including a spell in the lead until a suspension failure led to retirement.
