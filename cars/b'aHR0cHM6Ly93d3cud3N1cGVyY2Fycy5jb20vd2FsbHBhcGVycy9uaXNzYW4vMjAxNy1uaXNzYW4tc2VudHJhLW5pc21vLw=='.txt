the 2017 nissan sentra nismo is the latest in a long line of compact nissan performance sedans going back nearly 50 years to the datsun 510 and the original sentra se-r. the new, first-ever sentra nismo is also the first mainstream u.s. nissan model to offer motorsports-inspired nismo factory-tuned performance. it joins the gt-r nismo, 370z nismo, juke nismo and juke nismo rs in the 2017 nissan lineup.
the 2017 nissan sentra nismo model’s comprehensive transformation from everyday sedan to a highly personal performance machine includes aggressive exterior treatment, performance-oriented interior and unique suspension tuning.
at the heart of any nismo-badged production vehicle is the engine, such as the gt-r nismo’s 600-horsepower 3.8-liter v6. for the new sentra nismo, the engineers started with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that fit perfectly within the aerodynamically aggressive sentra nismo bodywork. more than just an engine transplant, however, the motorsports-inspired transformation from practical sedan to a vehicle worthy of the nismo badge involved a precisely balanced tuning of body, interior, chassis, suspension, steering and powertrain.
