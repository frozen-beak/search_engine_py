bmw has upgraded their i8 hybrid supercar with a little more power, a little better mpg and an open top roadster variant. the plug-in hybrid drivetrain has been enlarged from 7.1kwh to 11.6kwh, translating into an extra 12 hp from the electric motor and nearly 34 miles in all-electric mode. the coupe can finish the 0-100 kph sprint in 4.4 seconds, with the roadster taking an extra 0.2 seconds. the official factory fuel economy rating has also risen to 149.8mpg for the coupe and 134.5mpg for the roadster. these numbers are always best case scenario, with owners needing to constantly keep the batteries charged to get anywhere near those numbers.
thanks to the use of a very rigid and light carbon fibre tub construction, the i8 roadster only weighs 60kg heavier than the coupe at 1,595kg. the soft top folding roof is a compact fabric unit, that stows away under the rear buttresses when stowed. the 20 inch wheels feature a new design for the 2019 model year, and the headlights utilise bmwâ€™s laser light technology.
