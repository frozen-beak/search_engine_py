bmw’s super saloon m5 competition has received some minor upgrades as part of the refreshed 5-series for 2021. the minor changes cover visual, suspension and technology upgrades. visually, the new m5 competition looks very similar to before with tweaks to the front and rear bumpers and lights helping to keep the m5’s look fresh when compared to it’s german rivals. 
the suspension upgrades have focused on new adaptive damper rates with bmw’s coil spring set-up, which should improve handling performance and feel. the brakes have also gotten some attention with a new m compound package with lighter brake rotors in either cast iron or full carbon-ceramic. the calipers can be optioned in red, blue or black colours.
on the tech side, the infotainment system now has a bigger touchscreen measuring 12.3-inches. the idrive functionality remains the same with the usual bmw rotary selector and physical switches still present.
