the murcielago lp640 versace edition is technically the same as the regular lp640, and it features an all-white exterior and a matching customized interior.
the body of the murcielago lp640 with its characteristic scissor doors is created from the prized union of sheet steel and honeycombed carbon fiber, glued and riveted together.
driving, handling and stability at high speed are enhanced by new springs and stabilizers, as well as by a redesigned electronically controlled damper. the “antidive” and “anti-squat” features on the axles, which efficiently prevent so-called “brake diving” and “squatting”, have not been changed. the two springs on every rear wheel, the single spring on every front wheel and the damper are placed coaxially.
