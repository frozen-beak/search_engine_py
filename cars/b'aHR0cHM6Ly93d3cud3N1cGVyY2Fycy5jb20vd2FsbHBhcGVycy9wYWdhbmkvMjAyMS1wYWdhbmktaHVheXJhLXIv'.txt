the track-only pagani huayra r has arrived, and it’s rocking a naturally aspirated v12 with over 800 hp that screams up to 9,000 rpm. the engine is an all-new creation by mercedes-amg’s racing subsidiary, hwa, and forgoes the twin turbocharged setup seen in all road-legal huayras. hwa have also provided a new six-speed sequential transmission which is very light and forms a structural part of the car.
in an effort to remove even more weight, pagani have modified the huayra chassis with lighter materials and fitted a roll-bar and chassis-mounted seats. as a result, the dry weight tips the scales at only 2,314 lbs, a few hundred pounds less than the road goin version. an inconel exhaust system has been fitted to compliment the screaming v12, which can be made even louder with the ability to remove the mufflers when running on race tracks without noise restrictions.
