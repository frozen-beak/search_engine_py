the toyota s-fr is a concept vehicle that continues the proud heritage of toyota’s fun-to-drive lightweight sports cars. pitched as an entry-level model, the new concept emphasizes responsiveness, and aims to make a whole new generation fall in love with driving.
benefiting from the unique advantages of a lightweight sports car, the concept offers smooth, responsive and direct handling that gives a real sense of communication between car and driver―one key benefit of the fr (front engine/rear drive) format.
the concept’s long nose and wide stance make for an archetypal sports car profile, while the familiar roundness of its frame inspires a feeling of closeness. the simple and modern finish of the interior rounds off a design that stresses approachable simplicity while conveying the vehicle’s performance and sporty spirit.
the full-fledged fr layout gives the engine a front midship location. optimal weight distribution and independent suspension make for outstanding cornering performance. a six-speed manual transmission offers smooth acceleration, adding to the car’s fun, responsive drive.
