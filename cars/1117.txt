while obviously being closely related to the bmw z4 m roadster, this fixed-roof two-seater goes its own way also in its design and styling. the low and sleek curvature of the roof typical of a coupé and the striking look of the car from the side make this new model unmistakable at first sight. 
the bmw z4 m coupé is now bringing to life the concept car presented by bmw at the 2005 frankfurt motor show in its most sporting and dynamic rendition. a great wish and sincere hope expressed by many sports car enthusiasts everywhere is therefore now becoming reality faster than expected. entering the market at the same time as the bmw z4 coupé 3.0si, the bmw z4 m coupé is the most impressive proof of the huge dynamic potential and performance this new model variant is able to offer.
