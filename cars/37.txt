the 25th anniversary edition of the lamborghini countach was named to celebrate the company’s twenty-fifth anniversary in 1988. this model saw further visual changes with the rear ‘air-box’ intake-ducts being enlarged and extended with a more gradual incline helping aerodynamics. the secondary pair of debossed ducts were brought forward to locate directly on top allowing the airboxes, located behind the radiators to be rotated from a transverse to a longitudinal position, providing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. the rear section of the car also saw some attention, with the new outwardly extension on the bumper element. the 25th anniversary lamborghini countach was in production until 1990 until the new diablo supercar was introduced and the countach model phased out.
