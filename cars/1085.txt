canepa, the company who restore important road cars and competition vehicles, have produced this awesome bmw m1 procar, complete in all its glory. this example started life as a back-up to the bmw procar series built as number 31 out of 40, but never got the chance to race. later it was converted to standard street car spec, and spent it’s life at the hands of various owners. modifications were made to the car, until canepa got their hands on it, and wove their magic.
the project included the aim to make the procar street legal, and run on low 91 octane fuel. the engine is an bmw m88 straight 6 unit that has been bored and stroked from 3.5l to 3.8l. most of the engines internal have been tweaked to produce over 400 horsepower at the crank. the chassis has been strengthened and custom-valved penske coilovers have been utilised for the suspension. finally the wheels keep the original style, but have been enlarged from 16 inches to 17 inches to better accommodate newer tyre sizes.
