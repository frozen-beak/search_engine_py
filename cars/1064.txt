the 2011 geneva motor show will see the world premier of the bmw connecteddrive concept car. the concept study, in a two-seat roadster guise, presents the automobile as a fully integrated part of the networked world in both its design and technological innovations. it is with this concept that bmw presents the potential of current and future in-car technology for optimizing comfort, safety and infotainment.
the bmw connecteddrive concept employs a layering principal in its design, demonstrating the bond between the driver, passenger, vehicle and the surrounding environment.  this is visualised by the complex light installation which shows the path of data exchange with the driver and passenger as the start and end point of each interaction.
the interior is divided into three layers – comfort, infotainment and safety – each with a corresponding light installation. each layer is defined by a colour, rhythm, motion and texture and, through the transparent surfaces the path taken by the information can be seen via fiber optic lighting.
