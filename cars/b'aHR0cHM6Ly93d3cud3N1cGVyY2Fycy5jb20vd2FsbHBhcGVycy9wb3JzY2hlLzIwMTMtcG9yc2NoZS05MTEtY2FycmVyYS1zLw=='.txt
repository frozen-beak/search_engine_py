a completely new generation of the iconic coupe that has been acclaimed as one of the world’s benchmark sports cars since its launch in 1963.
true to the 911 tradition, the distinctive porsche design language exudes power and elegance. the unmistakable silhouette still catches the eye while incorporating new, exciting contours and precisely designed details; a 100mm longer wheelbase for improved stability and greater interior space; front and rear overhangs are shorter, maintaining the compact footprint that has been a longstanding 911 attribute; the sporting stance is emphasised by the lower roof line and a wider front track increases on-road presence further still while raising the renowned chassis dynamics.
the rear-mounted, flat six cylinder engine is an equally symbolic component of the 911 identity; and behind the rear axle of the new car lies an uprated range of powerful, efficient and evocative ‘boxer’ engines. the porsche 911 carrera is powered by a new 3.4-litre engine developing 350 hp, and the carrera s features a 400 hp version of the familiar 3.8-litre. these new engines offer performance improvements for both models. the 3.4-litre carrera with pdk accelerates from 0-62mph in 4.6 sec, 0.1 sec quicker than the prior model. pressing the sport plus button on the optional sport chrono pack cuts that to 4.4 sec. the 3.8-litre carrera s with pdk can accelerate from 0- 62 mph in 4.3 sec (sport plus 4.1 sec), 0.2sec quicker than its predecessor.
