the bugatti eb110 is a mid-engine sports car from bugatti automobili spa. it was unveiled on september 15, 1991, in both versailles and in front of the grande arche at la défense in paris, france, exactly 110 years after ettore bugatti’s birth. the car has a 60-valve, quad-turbo v12 powering all four wheels through a six-speed gearbox. the 3.5 l (3499 cc) engine has a bore of 81 mm (3.2 in) and a stroke of 56.6 mm (2.23 in) and is capable of 553 hp (412 kw; 561 ps) at 8000 rpm.
the car uses a double wishbone suspension, with the chassis built by aérospatiale, an aircraft company, and made from carbon fiber. equipped with gandini’s famous lifting scissor doors, it has a glass engine cover that provides a view of the v12 engine along with a speed-sensitive electronic rear wing that can be raised at the flick of a switch. the shift-knob is placed closer to the driver so that less time is taken to shift. five pre-production prototypes with aluminum chassis were built, followed by eight with composite chassis. following these, it is believed that only 95 gt and 31 ss production models were constructed.
