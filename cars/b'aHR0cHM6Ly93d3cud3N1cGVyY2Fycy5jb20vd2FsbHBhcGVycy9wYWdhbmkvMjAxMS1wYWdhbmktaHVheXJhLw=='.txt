after the surprising and big success of the zonda, pagani have unveiled their all-new supercars called the huayra. featuring a new twin turbocharged v12 engine developed by amg, the huayra pumps out 720 hp and 1,000 nm of torque. with a 0-62 mph acceleration time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 232 mph, the huayra certainly has the performance credentials under it’s belt.
true to form, the huayra continues with the crazy attention to detail through it’s construction, utilising plenty of carbon fiber, aluminium and other light weight materials finished beautifully throughout. the interior is something to behold as one of the most amazing spaces ever created in a car. the solid metal controls, supple leather, and consistence styling cues all combine to create an amazing cabin that alone would justify the price tag.
on the outside the huayra has been styled much differently to the outgoing zonda. whilst sharing a similar side profile and overall form, pagani have gone for a smoother shape with lovely details to found all over the body. the nose of the car has a rather large air intake that may be somewhat controversial, but overall the looks are on point and should work well when the faster versions arrive with a few aero elements attached.
