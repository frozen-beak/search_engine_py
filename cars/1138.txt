the mercedes-benz c63 amg models are becoming even more dynamic: the amg high-performance cars are being fitted with an amg 6.3-litre v8 engine with increased output as exclusive “edition 507” models. the increase of 37 kw / 50 hp now brings output to 373 kw / 507 hp with a maximum torque of 610 nm, and is a result of a technology transfer from the sls amg: the eight-cylinder naturally aspirated engine from the super sports car features forged pistons, connecting rods and a lightweight crankshaft. an amg high-performance composite braking system with red brake callipers is fitted as standard.
the mercedes-benz c63 amg “edition 507” produces 373 kw / 507 hp, and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds in the guise of the saloon and coupé, and in 4.3 seconds as the estate. as such it outperforms the 336 kw / 457 hp standard model by two tenths of a second, and the variants with the amg performance package which produce 358 kw / 487 hp by one tenth of a second each. the top speed of all variants is 280 km/h (electronically limited): this is because as standard the “edition 507” models are fitted with the amg driver’s package.
externally, the mercedes-benz c63 amg “edition 507” is characterised by a host of exclusive design features: most notable among these is the bonnet – it originates from the c63 amg coupé black series. two openings in the distinctive aluminium bonnet help with expelling engine heat. new amg light-alloy cross-spoke wheels with tyres in sizes 235/35 r 19 (front) and 255/30 r 19 (rear) are another exclusive feature of the “edition 507”. the amg light-alloy wheels are produced using particularly lightweight forging technology and are available in two variants: painted in titanium grey with a high-sheen finish, or matt black with high-sheen rim flanges.
