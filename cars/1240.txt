celebrating 55 years of amg is the extremely limited edition gt3 edition 55 race car. what sets this version of the amg gt3 apart is the that it isn’t fia homologated, meaning it doesn’t have to adhere to gt3 restrictions. the result is an extra 100 horsepower from the 6.3l v8 after being uncorked and allowed to breathe freely. with the silencer removed from the exhaust, the total power output climbs to 650 hp, and it should create a lot more noise as well. mercedes are planning on building only 5 units with each fitted with an “edition 55 – 1 of 5” plaque.
