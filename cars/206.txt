sq8 e-tron takes the electric suv into the mainstream audi line-up, bringing with it more range and updated looks. audi are set to release their electric vehicles under the even number ranges (4, 6, 8) and leave, at least for the time being, the odd numbers as ice cars. this means the q8 series of suv’s will eventually transition to full electric across the range in the next few years.
available in both regular and sportback body styles, the new sq8 e-tron comes equipped with a 114 kwh (108 kwh useable) battery that along with an improved drag coefficient will provide 307 miles of range. powered by a triple motor setup, one up front and two in the rear, the sq8 delivers a peak power output of 496 hp and 718 lb-ft of torque.
