the diablo sv was first introduced at the 1995 geneva auto show and featured a power bump over the diablo vt with the removal of the all-wheel drive system reverting to a rear-wheel drive setup. the return of the super veloce nameplate was the first time since the lamborghini miura sv, and would later be applied to the light weight high power versions of lamborghini’s hero cars such as the murcielago and aventador.
apart from the increase in power output, the sv wore bigger front brakes with larger 18 inch wheels to fit around them. exterior changes included black tail lamp surrounds, repositioned rear fog and reverse lamps, dual front fog lamps, an extra set of front brake cooling ducts, a ducted engine lid and optional “sv” decals for the sides of the car.
