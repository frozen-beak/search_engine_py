the new porsche cayman gt4 has arrived with more power, a manual gearbox and a 10 second quicker lap time around the nordschleife. the flat 6 engine has been increased in capacity to 4.0l and much to the fans delight, remains naturally aspirated. peak power of 420 ps (309 kw) is available at 8,000 rpm, whilst peak torque of 310 lb-ft (420 nm) can used between 5,000 and 6,800 rpm. that is an increase of 35 ps over the previous gt4 cayman.
one of the main improvements for the gt4 is the aerodynamics, with porsche claiming a 50 percent increase in downforce with no increase in drag. a clubsport package is also available for those who want their gt4 to be even more track focused. this pack includes a rear steel roll bar, a hand-held fire extinguisher and a six-point seatbelt on the driver’s side.
