the new member of the porsche gt family is the porsche cayman gt4. this is the first time porsche is introducing a gt sports car based on the cayman which has components of the 911 gt3. a lap time of 7 minutes and 40 seconds on the north loop of the nürburgring positions the cayman gt4 as the new benchmark at the top of its market segment. it also makes a clear statement that porsche will continue to promote radical two-door sports cars in the future – sports cars that are developed at the motorsport department in weissach.
the engine, chassis, brakes and aerodynamic design of the porsche cayman gt4 are configured for maximum driving dynamics; yet the top model still retains the versatility and everyday utility that are typical of the two-seat porsche coupe. it is powered by a 3.8-litre flat-six engine with 385 hp (283 kw), which is derived from the 911 carrera s engine. its power is always transmitted by a six-speed manual gearbox with dynamic gearbox mounts. the cayman gt4 accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds; its top speed is 295 km/h. the car’s nedc fuel consumption is 10.3 l/100 km. the chassis – which features a 30 mm lower body position and a generously sized brake system – consists nearly entirely of components from the 911 gt3.
