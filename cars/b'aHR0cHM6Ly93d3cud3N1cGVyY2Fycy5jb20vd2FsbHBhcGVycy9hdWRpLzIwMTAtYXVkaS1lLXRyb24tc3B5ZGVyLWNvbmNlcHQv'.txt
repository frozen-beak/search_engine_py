audi presented the audi e-tron spyder concept, the study of an open sports car, at the 2010 paris motor show. the show car, with plug-in hybrid drive, is 4.06 meters (13.32 ft) long, 1.81 meters (5.94 ft) wide and only 1.11 meters (3.64 ft) high. the two-seater is equipped with a 221-kw / 300-hp) twin-turbo v6 tdi at the rear axle and two electric motors producing a total of 64 kw at the front axle.
the audi e-tron spyder concept’s low total weight of only around 1,450 kilograms (3,196.70 lb) combined with the high-torque tdi and the two electric motors results in respectable performance. the car accelerates to 100 km/h (62.14 mph) in just 4.4 seconds, and top speed is electronically governed at 250 km/h (155.34 mph).
the audi e-tron spyder concept can combine the powerful torque of its tdi – the diesel engine generates 650 nm / 479.42 lb-ft) and the total of 352 nm / 259.62 lb-ft) of its two electric motors during acceleration in a process known as “boosting.” the intelligent distribution of power allows for optimal dynamics in every situation. the targeted application of power to the front wheels improves longitudinal dynamics while also improving lateral dynamics when cornering. this is because torque vectoring – the as-needed distribution of torque between the left and right wheels of the two axles – enables an exhilarating degree of driving precision and excellent agility.
