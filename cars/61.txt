“the new lp 560-4 spyder adds another dimension to the gallardo’s lineage with extreme design language and class-leading performance,” says stephan winkelmann, president and ceo of automobili lamborghini. “the open version of the successful gallardo lp 560-4 is the result of lamborghini’s two model strategy including the gallardo and murciélago.”
the much anticipated gallardo lp 560-4 spyder offers a new 5.2 liter engine with 40 additional horsepower than its predecessor; allowing it to sprint from 0-62 mph in only four seconds with a top speed of 201 mph. the car’s agility has also been greatly refined with a new, lighter transmission, which allows increased shift times by 40 percent (corsa mode), combined with an all-new chassis, suspension and lamborghini’s permanent all-wheel drive system. despite increased performance, fuel consumption and co2 emissions have been reduced by 18 percent.
