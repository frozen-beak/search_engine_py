the 2020 cayman gts 4.0 offers a similar package to the top of the line gt4 at a lower price with a few compromises. those compromises are found in the slightly less power and not quite all the performance and handling parts that the gt4 enjoys. the end result though should be a cayman that hits the right spots and appeals to a broader spectrum of buyers.
the 4.0l 6 cylinder engine is a naturally aspirated unit that has some ecu tweaks to tone down the power by around 20 horsepower from the gt4â€™s version. performance still remains strong though, with the 0-62 mph sprint dispatched in 4.5 seconds and the top speed still a healthy 182 mph.
