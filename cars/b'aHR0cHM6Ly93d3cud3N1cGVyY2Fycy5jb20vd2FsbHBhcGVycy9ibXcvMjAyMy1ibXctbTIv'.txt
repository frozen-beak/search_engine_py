bmw’s new m2 has arrived, promising to get back to the roots of the m car with a more engaging driving experience. the package is simple, a straight six engine up front, six-speed manual gearbox in the middle and rear wheel drive. no hybrid or electric assistance in sight, no all-wheel drive or overly bloated weight, the m2 is bmw’s entry-level m car that is keeping is simple.
powering the new m2 is the same s58 twin turbocharged 3.0l inline 6 as found in the m3 and m4, producing 453 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque in this guise. performance is quoted at 4.3 seconds 0-60 mph for the six-speed manual or 4.1 seconds for the eight-speed auto which makes it 0.1 seconds quicker than the previous m2 competition with dct transmission.
bmw’s styling has been somewhat controversial so far in the 2020’s, and this m2 seems to straddle the line of not being overly offensive, yet not exactly beautiful. the overall look is aggressive with a squared off front fascia and pumped-up wheel arches. the quad tail pipes out back show this car means business, and the lack of extra aero elements attached to the bodywork keeps the styling clean.
