the 8-series concept car is a design study and taster for the planned return of the bmw 8-series coupe in 2018, part of the biggest model offensive in bmw’s history. the design pulls in forms recognisable from previous bmw models and adds new design ideas and form-building techniques to promote a fresh look and herald the coming of a new design language for the company. the return of the 8-series coupe will be the first time since the mid 90’s that bmw have offered a top of the range luxury sports coupe, with power and looks to match. if the concept is anything to go by, the new 8-series should have no trouble cementing itself as a highly desirable car atop of the bmw family tree.
“the number 8 has always represented the pinnacle of sports performance and exclusivity at bmw,” explains chairman of the board of management of bmw ag harald krüger. “the forthcoming bmw 8-series coupe will demonstrate that razor-sharp dynamics and modern luxury can go hand-in-hand. this will be the next model in the expansion of our luxury-car offering and will raise the benchmark for coupes in the segment. in the process, we will strengthen our claim to leadership in the luxury class.”
“the bmw concept 8-series is our take on a full-blooded high-end driving machine,” says adrian van hooydonk, senior vice president bmw group design. “it is a luxurious sports car which embodies both unadulterated dynamics and modern luxury like arguably no other. for me, it’s a slice of pure automotive fascination.”
