the mercedes-amg gt now has a new family member that sits at the top of the range, the track focused gt r. with extensive development in the “green hell” of the nurburgring racetrack and the paint work to match, the new amg gt r provides improved performance and driver feel. more power, lighter weight, better aero, and tuned chassis all combine to make this the fastest, most focused amg gt to date.
the v8 under the hood has been given even more power from the boffins at amg, with peak output now rated at 577 horsepower and 516lb ft of torque from just 1,900 rpm right through to 5,500 rpm. light weight materials such as carbon fiber and magnesium have been used in great effect to reduce the cars weight. the wider front track, adjustable rear wing, front grille and adaptive aero are all inspired by the gt3 race car development program. overall the bodywork now generates 155kg more downforce at maximum speed than any other amg gt.
“it combines the driving dynamics of our amg gt3 racing car with the everyday practicality of the amg gt. those with petrol in their veins will be thrilled by the radical longitudinal and lateral acceleration, the precise turn-in, and the sensational grip. we have modified all performance-relevant components and linked them together intelligently for maximum driving dynamics,” says tobias moers, ceo of mercedes amg.
