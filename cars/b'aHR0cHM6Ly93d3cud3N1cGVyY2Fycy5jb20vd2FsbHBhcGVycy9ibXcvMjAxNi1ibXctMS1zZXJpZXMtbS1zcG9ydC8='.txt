an extensively modified front- and rear-end design, a sophisticated premium ambience when you step inside and fresh reserves of power under the bonnet are all part of the even more expressive, sporting and efficiency-focused skillset of the new bmw 1-series model range.
the selection of engines available for the new bmw 1-series model range has been enhanced by the addition of latest-generation petrol and diesel units with three and four cylinders. the torquey and high-revving engines with bmw twinpower turbo technology team up with rear-wheel drive – still a unique selling point in the compact segment – to deliver a suitably intense driving experience. and an even broader spread of standard equipment, an output boost for the six-cylinder in-line engine powering the bmw m135i m performance automobile and cutting-edge innovations from bmw connecteddrive also imbue the brand’s hallmark characteristics with renewed vigour.
