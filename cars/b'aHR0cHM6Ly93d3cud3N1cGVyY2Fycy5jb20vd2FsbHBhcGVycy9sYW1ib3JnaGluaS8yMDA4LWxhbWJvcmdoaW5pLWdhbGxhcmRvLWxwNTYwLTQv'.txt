with the new gallardo lp560-4, lamborghini once again sets a higher standard for super sports cars. with its new engine, permanent four-wheel drive transmission and new suspension, it delivers clearly improved performance and dynamics. in parallel, its innovative design takes the classic lines unique to the lamborghini brand one step further. powerful elegance has never been so defined before.
the powerful heart of the gallardo lp560-4 is the new 5.2 litre v10 engine with an output of 560 ps (412 kw) at 8000 rpm. the increase of 40 ps compared with that of the previous gallardo, and the approximate 20 kilogram reduction in weight, improves the power weight ratio to 2.5 kilograms per ps (hp) and thus enhances performance. the lp560-4 accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 3.7 seconds, its speed at 11.8 seconds is 200 km/h and its top speed lies at 325 km/h. at the same time the new, highly efficient engine enthrals its driver with its direct fuel injection system – “iniezione diretta stratificata”.
the engineers in the sant’agata-based technical department have also improved traction, handling and stability at high speeds. the redesigned four-wheel drive transmission, the new suspension and the optimised aerodynamics as well as the reduced weight and decreased friction between the components, all contribute to the overall improvements in the vehicle. thus the gallardo lp560-4 presents itself as a cutting edge super sports car also suitable for the race-track. the car is also surprisingly suited to long-distance driving and despite its extreme performance capabilities is easy to control whilst maintaining utmost stability.
