bmw are set to launch a new top tier model in their 2-series range called the m2 cs. lighter, faster and more powerful than the m2 competition, the new m2 cs could become a worthy rival to the porsche cayman gt4. the normal m2 first launched in 2016 and has seen significant improvements since with the competition and now cs models each upping the m2’s performance credentials. in fact bmw are so confident about the sporting capabilities of the cs, they are basing a new amateur racing series on it for 2020.
peak power has been raised to 450 ps (331 kw), which is an improvement of 40 ps (29 kw) on the older m2 competition. torque remains the same at a healthy 405 lb-ft (550 nm), but the 0-62 mph sprint has been reduced by 0.2 seconds to 4.0 seconds flat. further improvements are achieved with the addition of the adaptive m suspension usually reserved for the m4, sticky michelin cup tyres for greater all-round performance and optional m carbon ceramic brakes.
to distinguish from the competition m2, the cs features new carbon fiber front splitter, hood, roof, boot lid spoiler and rear diffuser. the lightweight hood and roof sections help to lower the cars centre of gravity, whilst also improving aero efficiency and cooling. the forged wheels are 19-inch y-spoke designs in a high-gloss black finish weighing only 9 kg for the 9-inch width fronts, and less than 10 kg for the 10-inch width rears. the tyre sizes comprise of 245/35 zr 19 at the front, and 265/35 zr 19 at the rear.
