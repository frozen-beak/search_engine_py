combining the past racing history of the mercedes silver arrows with the future of the brands eq electric vehicles, comes the vision eq silver arrows concept. unveiled at the 2018 pebble beach concours d’elegance, the eq silver arrows concept car is a homage to the mercedes w 125 which won the 1937 european championship.
designed as a single seater, the body work is made entirely from carbon fiber and finished with alubeam silver paint that mimics the metallic look of the original silver arrow grand prix racers. mercedes are claiming the electric powertrain is capable of delivering 738 horsepower, and is backed by a 80 kwh battery pack that is good for a 250 mile range.
“over 80 years ago, the historic silver arrows demonstrated that mercedes-benz was a pioneer when it came to speed thanks, among other things, to their streamlined shape,” says gorden wagener, chief design officer at daimler ag. “the vision eq silver arrow draws on that legacy. intended for acceleration and driving pleasure, it embodies progressive luxury and provides an insight into the future of our design. as a result, the show car drives the design idiom of our new eq product and technology brand to the top.”
