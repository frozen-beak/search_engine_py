there is a new record holder for the fastest road-legal sports car around the nürburgring-nordschleife. porsche in cooperation with manthey-racing have created the porsche gt2 rs mr, which has completed a lap of the 20.6-kilometre circuit in just 6 minutes and 40.3 seconds. that time beats the previous record held by the 2019 lamborghini aventador svj, which itself beat the 2018 porsche gt2 rs for the fastest time.
the modifications of the 911 gt2 rs were focused on the chassis and aerodynamics, with porsche utilising their experience gained from developing the 911 rsr and 911 gt3 r race cars. whilst manthey-racing brought their wealth of experience in their successful races at the nürburgring-nordschleife. 31 year old development engineer and racer lars kern was the man behind the wheel, who enjoyed a dry autumn day for the record breaking lap.
“the drive was great fun,” says lars kern. “the balance of the car is also very good with the new package. i did not have to take any great risks to be fast. but i only had one attempt because it was already getting dark. it worked out first time though.” manthey-racing ceo nicolas raeder adds: “we are very proud. it was a great challenge to make the already tremendously fast porsche 911 gt2 rs even faster.”
