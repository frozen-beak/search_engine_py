the world premiere of the bmw i3 concept coupe sees the bmw group unveil a particularly nimble and emotive version of its concept for sustainable premium-class motoring with zero local emissions. the study presented at the 2012 los angeles auto show has been brought out in parallel to the ongoing development process for getting the first ever all-electric model from the bmw i brand ready for series production, and demonstrates the potential for conceivably extending the model range. the state-of-the-art, clean-cut and open design showcased by the bmw i3 concept coupe represents a pioneering form of urban mobility that makes sustainability awareness an intrinsic part of the premium profile. beyond this, the three-door model employs the design idiom that has been created especially for the bmw i cars to convey an undeniable sense of dynamism and driving pleasure.
the carbon-fibre body’s visual impact is largely shaped by the gracefully flowing coupe roof line and the fresh interpretation of the bmw i “stream flow” design that can be seen in the side window styling, and gives an instant impression of lightness, transparency and streamlined aerodynamic qualities. on the inside, the sense of spaciousness typical of the bmw i brand is combined with an exclusive lounge-style ambience in the two individual rear seats. the bmw i3 concept coupe furthermore assumes the title of the world’s first fully networked electric vehicle. thanks to the inclusion of innovative bmw connecteddrive functions that have been devised by bmw i for use in production vehicles, operation of the navigation system as well as the information transfer between the vehicle, the outside world and the driver’s smartphone has been geared towards the specific requirements of e-mobility.
