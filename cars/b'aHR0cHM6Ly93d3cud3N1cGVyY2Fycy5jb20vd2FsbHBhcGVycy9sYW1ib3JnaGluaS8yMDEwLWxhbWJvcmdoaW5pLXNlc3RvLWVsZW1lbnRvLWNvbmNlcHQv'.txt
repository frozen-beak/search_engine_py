with the sesto elemento, lamborghini’s r&d engineers have put together a groundbreaking package. as a pure and radical concept, the sesto elemento is the unique synthesis of an extremely low curb weight of less than 1,000 kilograms, enormous 570 ps output, the sensitive and prompt responsiveness of the high-revving, naturally-aspirated v10 engine and the superior traction and stability of permanent all-wheel drive – there has never been a super sports car as thoroughbred as this. sesto elemento delivers an unbelievable degree of driving fun, concentrated on absolutely sensational dynamics.
the basis is an extremely solid, stiff, safe and lightweight carbon-fiber structure: the monocoque cell of the sesto elemento. the entire front frame, the exterior panels and crash boxes are also made from cfrp. the sesto elemento’s major suspension components and the rims are made from carbon fiber. the tailpipes are made from pyrosic, which is an advanced glass-ceramic matrix composite, able to reach and stand very high temperatures up to 900° celsius. even the propeller shaft is made of cfrp.
carbon composite materials are a key technology for the automotive engineering of tomorrow, especially for high-performance sports cars. these materials made from carbon-fiber reinforced plastics combine the lowest weight with excellent characteristics – they are extremely stiff and highly precise. lighter cars improve fuel consumption and co2 emissions: above all, however, it improves the power-to-weight ratio – the crucial factor for a sports car – and thus the performance. a super sports car built using cfrp accelerates faster, has outstanding handling and better braking.
