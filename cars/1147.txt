after the launch of the new a-class, mercedes-benz have improved the four-door coupe cla models with the new longer, wider and lower platform. the cla takes it’s place as the smaller version of the premium mercedes cls, and is very similar in appearance to the a-class sedan. marketed as a coupe, the 2020 mercedes cla has seen some structural changes that provide a more aggressive stance and premium look. the lower and wider body contribute to this along with the cabin moving back and the hood being lengthened.
a 1.33l inline 4 turbo package is available along with two 2.0l inline 4 cylinder models in both petrol and diesel. that 2.0l petrol stands as the range topping choice with 225 ps (165 kw) and 258 lb-ft (350 nm) on tap. power runs through a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. the performance amg models are set to arrive at a later date with the possibility of a 302 ps (222 kw) cla35 and 400 ps (294 kw) odd cla45.
