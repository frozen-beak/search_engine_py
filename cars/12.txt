limited to just 500 units, and presented at the 2015 monterey car week in california, the aventador sv roadster is the first super series open-top lamborghini to bear the name superveloce. continuing on from the sv coupe, the roadster loses nothing in performance with speed apparent everywhere on the spec sheet. as with the aventador lp700-4 roadster, the sv uses a two piece removable roof section that consists of carbon fiber featuring technologies such as rtm and forged composite. this enables complex design shapes and the highest possible component stiffness to achieve extremely low weight.
lamborghini uses the a 7-speed isr transmission with power going to all four wheels through a haldex generation iv 4wd system. the suspension comprises of adaptive magneto rheological suspension, a pushrod damping system and lamborghini dynamic steering (lds) for improved driving dynamics. top speed remains a face blasting 350 kph and the 0-100 kph run is done and dusted in just 2.9 seconds, cementing the aventador superveloce as one of the fastest lamborghinis ever.
“the superveloce is the purest, most sports-oriented and fastest series production lamborghini ever. the roadster version represents our commitment to satisfying our passionate clients with immensely emotional driving dynamics combined with an extraordinary open air experience,” stephan winkelmann, president and ceo of automobili lamborghini said during the press conference at the quail.
