bmw’s touring coupe concept teases a shooting brake z4, harking back to the ‘clown shoe’ z3 m from the late 1990’s. unfortunately this remains just that, a tease, as bmw have already confirmed this will not be making production. with that in mind we just have this to look at and think, “do shooting brake body styles look good?” yes… yes they do.
