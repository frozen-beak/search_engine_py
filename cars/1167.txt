mercedes cla concept previews a future entry level electric sedan that uses tech from the hyper efficient vision eqxx concept. the battery tech fitted to that concept was capable of delivering up to 620 miles of range from its 100 kwh capacity, which equals an incredible 6 miles per kwh. this cla-class concept is aiming to achieve a range of more than 466 miles from a 90 kwh battery, which would be an efficiency of 5.2 miles per kwh.
the electric powertrain consists of a single e-motor with almost no heavy rare earth metals rated at 235 hp that is connected to a two-speed transmission. the electronics use silicon carbide semiconductors and the entire package weighs in at just 243 pounds and has an energy efficiency of up to 93% in long distance driving.
