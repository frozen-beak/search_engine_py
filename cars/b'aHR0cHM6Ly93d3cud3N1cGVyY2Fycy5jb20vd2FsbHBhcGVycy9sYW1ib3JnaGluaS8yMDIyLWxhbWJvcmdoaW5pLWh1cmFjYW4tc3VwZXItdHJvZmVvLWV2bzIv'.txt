lamborghini squadra corse have taken the huracan racing since it’s initial release, now the super trofeo has been updated to version 2 of it’s evo spec. there are currently 3 different one-make race series that the huracan super trofeo competes in, with the evo2 set to be available for the 2022 seasons.
the powertrain has remained the same for this updated spec with aerodynamic and visual changes taking up all the attention. the different look will perhaps give us a look at what the updated road going huracan set to come in late 2021 may look like. key details to note are the super slim front and rear lights, which are a very popular trend for car design in the early stages of the 2020’s. so expect the new look huracan to sport a similar look.
