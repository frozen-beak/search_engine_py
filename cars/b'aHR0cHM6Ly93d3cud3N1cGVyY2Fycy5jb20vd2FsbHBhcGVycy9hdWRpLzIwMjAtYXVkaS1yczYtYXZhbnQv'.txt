audi’s new 592 horsepower, 190mph rs6 avant is the latest in the line of fast audi estate cars that started 25 years ago with the rs2. the design of the 2020 rs6 is perhaps audi’s most aggressive yet. the majority of the bodywork is new aside from the roof, tailgate and front doors, with the headlights the same matrix led units as seen on the a7. the new panels feature more angular lines with large intakes and grills.
the twin turbocharged v8 has been refreshed by audi sport, and now delivers 590 lb-ft (800 nm) of torque which is maintained between 2,050 and 4,500 rpm. power is also very strong with 600 ps (441 kw) on tap, this all equates to a 0-62 mph sprint of 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 190 mph with the ‘dynamic package’ selected. the audi quattro all-wheel drive system is present, receiving power from an 8-speed automatic transmission.
this will be the first rs6 avant available to purchase in north america, which could signal that perhaps automakers are changing their thinking that us buyers don’t want wagons.
