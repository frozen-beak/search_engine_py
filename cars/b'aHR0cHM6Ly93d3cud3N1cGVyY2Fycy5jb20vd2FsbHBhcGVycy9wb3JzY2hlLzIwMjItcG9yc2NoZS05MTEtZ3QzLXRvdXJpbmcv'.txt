the porsche 911 gt3 touring has been revealed, offering a manual transmission with more understated looks. continuing off where the previous 991 gt3 touring left off, the new 992 generation brings all the same mechanical goodness to the party in a package thatâ€™s a little bit les shouty.
the most noticeable difference for the touring is the re-instated active spoiler from the 911, which replaces the swan-neck rear wing of the regular gt3. also different is the body-coloured front bumper, brightwork around the windows and a new engine cover with mesh insert.
