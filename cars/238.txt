for the first time, audi sport will offer a racing sports car specifically developed for customer use in the form of the powerful 500 hp plus gt3 version of the audi r8. the audi r8 conforms to the production-based gt3 regulations allowing the car to be fielded in numerous national and international race series. audi respects the spirit of the class – to offer production based, low-cost but powerful racing cars – in all aspects of the vehicle conception.
“the r8 is the first production audi bearing the name and genes of a successful racing sportscar and is therefore an excellent base from which to build up our first big customer sport programme, explains head of audi motorsport dr wolfgang ullrich. “ever since the r8 was unveiled weve been inundated with enquiries about a race version. with the audi r8 we will offer customers a racing sportscar equipped with high-calibre technology and the typical audi qualities, but which is nevertheless easy to handle.
