techart automobil design presents its personalisation program for porsche 911 carrera 4 models. in line with this premiere the new techart exhaust system racing with valve control and double centre tailpipes as well as the techart noselift front axle lift system make their debuts.
as a tribute to the porsche models of the 1970s techart shows its interpretation of the 400 hp porsche 911 carrera 4s in legendary emerald green colour to public at 83rd geneva international motor show from march 5 to 17 2013.
the new techart exhaust system racing with valve control and double centre tailpipes replaces porsche’s standard exhaust system and gives the car a more aggressive and sporty look, which reminds of rsr models. controlled by the sport button at centre console the acoustic performance of the porsche 911 carrera 4s becomes clearly more sonorous and throaty. the exhaust system is also drivable in closed condition. as sole manufacturer techart currently offers this valve-controlled exhaust system with double centre tailpipes for all porsche 911 carrera s models.
