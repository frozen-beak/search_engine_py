last month at essen motor show techart automobildesign presented its individualization program for the new porsche 911 turbo models for the first time ever. the combination of techart front spoiler i, stationary techart rear spoiler ii, techart roof spoiler and techart rear diffuser trim generates an ideal air flow to the complete vehicle involving the active aerodynamics of the series front apron. by precise adaption to the basic vehicle’s design language, techart-typical design features like side skirts, headlamp trims, aero wings and sport tailpipes enhance the character of the porsche 911 turbo models explicitly. the new techart formula iv light-alloy wheels endorse the four-wheel drive’s sportive character.
wider, flatter and longer as its predecessors. the new porsche 911 turbo models make promises to performance, tradition and last but not least to technological leadership. a distinctive design as well as meaningful proportions and innovative aerodynamics express these attributes evidently. the techart aerodynamic kit copes with the characteristic design language of the basic vehicle in a technical, qualitative and stylistic way.
