the porsche 718 boxster gts, a coming together of all the juiciest equipment off the options list to make the fastest boxster in the family. highlights include sport chrono, porsche torque vectoring with a mechanical limited slip differential and pasm variable dampers as standard equipment. a new sports front bumper design is also included to help provide a visual difference between the gts and the regular models. along with the cayman gts, this is the first time the gts car has used a turbocharged 4 cylinder engine, instead of the old flat 6 from the previous generation.
power has been increased 15 hp from 350 to 365, thanks to a redesigned air intake and a recalibration of the engine’s ecu. torque also gets a bump now up to 430 nm, which is available from a low 1,900rpm and holds it all the way to 5,000rpm. porsche has retained the choice of either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed pdk transmission, so fans of a proper manual will rejoice.
