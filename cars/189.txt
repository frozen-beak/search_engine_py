audi’s most powerful production car ever has just landed, with over 900 horsepower on tap. for the revised 2025 model year of audi’s rs e-tron gt, a new, top-of-the-line performance model has been added into the mix, with more power than ever before. 912 hp and 2.5 seconds are the headline figures for the audi rs e-tron gt performance, thanks to the twin motor, all-wheel drive, 105 kwh setup. with the porsche taycan recently getting a big power bump, it was only natural that audi would follow suit, positioning the e-tron as close enough whilst not stepping on the porsche’s toes.
