imagine bugatti’s awesome 8.0l w16 engine stuffed into a light weight track car! well, now bugatti have made it a reality with the bolide concept car combining 1,825 horsepower in a light weight 1,240 kg package. that’s right, no longer held back by big heavy cars such as the veyron and chiron, the w16 is not only more powerful but boasts an incredible power to weight ratio of 0.67 kg per hp. tat’s a figure that nearly reaches formula 1 levels.
claiming to have a top speed north of 310 mph, the bugatti bolide has racked up runs of the famous le mans and nordschleife tracks clocking lap times of 3:07.1 minutes and 5:23.1 minutes respectively. this is essentially a race car bugatti has built, with full compliance to fia safety regulations and lots of racing technology throughout.
the power output of 1,825 hp with 1,850 nm of torque has been achieved via new turbos and other tweaks designed to enable more power at higher engine speeds. the extreme weight reduction is thanks to every fastener being made completely out of titanium, hollow, thin-walled components made from a titanium alloy and of course plenty of carbon fiber. the bodywork has been designed for maximum aero performance with 1,800 kilograms of downforce generated at the rear wing, and 800 kilograms at the front wing when travelling at the speed of 325 kph.
