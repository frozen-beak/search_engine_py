the new 2016 porsche 911 r follows the tradition set by the first road-homologated race car bearing the name in 1967. produced as part of a limited production series, the original 911 r (r for racing) was entered in rallies, in the targa florio and in world record runs. like its legendary predecessor, the new 911 r features a systematic lightweight construction, a high level of performance and an unfiltered driving experience. the 911 r is limited to 991 units worldwide, and represents the lightest available version of the 911 with a curb weight of just 3,021 pounds. powered by a 500 hp four-liter naturally aspirated flat-six engine which is mated to a six-speed manual transmission, the 911 r underscores porsche’s commitment to building emotional and engaging high-performance sports cars with a maximum amount of driving pleasure. developed by porsche’s motorsport department, the 911 r is the third model to use porsche’s latest generation of high-performance naturally aspirated flat-six engines alongside the track-bred 911 gt3 and 911 gt3 rs models.
the 911 r was designed with corners in mind. the specially tuned standard rear-axle steering offers direct turn-in response and precise handling while maintaining a high level of stability. the mechanical rear differential lock ensures a maximum amount of traction, while the standard porsche ceramic composite brake (pccb) system with 16.1 inch front and 15.4 inch rear rotors offers ultimate braking performance. ultra-high performance tires measuring 245 millimeters at the front and 305 millimeters at the rear generate significant levels of grip. they are mounted on forged, lightweight 20-inch wheels with a matte aluminum finish and center locking hubs.
