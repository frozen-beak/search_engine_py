exquisite luxury and particularly comprehensive standard features are on offer from the porsche panamera exclusive series. finished in the exclusive factory, the series is limited to 100 units worldwide. it is based on the panamera turbo s executive, the 570 hp (419 kw) top version of the grand tourer with a long wheelbase and very generously proportioned rear passenger space. the world premiere takes place at the 2014 los angeles auto show.
being provided by porsche for the first time on the panamera exclusive series is two-colour, graduated paintwork: below the door handles a contrast is created with the timeless deep black metallic paint by a chestnut brown metallic colour that runs in the background along the lines of the car to the rear. every one of the 100 vehicles is being painted by hand in order to ensure a harmonious blend of colour. the front air inlet grilles and the 20-inch wheels in the sport classic design are, for instance, also deep black metallic.
