sending off the 991 generation of the porsche 911 with style is the 911 speedster ii concept that is scheduled to go into production in the first half of 2019. the speedster will be limited to 1,948 units built and mark the end of the 991 as the new 992 arrives in 2019.
using the underpinnings of the 911 gt3, the speedster ii concept has been developed by porsche motorsport and uses the body of a 911 carrera 4 cabriolet. the revised bodywork is made from a carbon fibre composite, and provides a unique look for this generation 911. the front windscreen has more of a lean, sitting back at a greater angle, with narrower side glass to suit. the engine cover has two prominent humps for the roll bars, and features a plexiglass wind deflector between the humps that reads ’70 years of porsche’ on it. no folding hard top or soft top roof is found on the speedster, with porsche supplying a tonneau cover as the only option to stay out of the wet.
perhaps the best part is the engine, suspension and chassis borrowed from the gt3. this means the speedster will be blessed with the full 513 ps (368 kw) 4.0l naturally aspirated flat 6 engine, a six-speed manual gearbox, and all the setup and tuning to make the car handle and perform the a gt3. new 21 inch cross-spoke wheels adorn the exterior with darkened led headlights up front, and the option for buyers to choose the porsche ‘heritage design package’ that includes colour and sticker options that reference past porsche greats.
