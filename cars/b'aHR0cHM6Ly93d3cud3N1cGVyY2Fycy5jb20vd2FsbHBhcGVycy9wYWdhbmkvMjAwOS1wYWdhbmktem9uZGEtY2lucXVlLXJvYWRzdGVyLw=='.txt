pagani have followed up the exclusive zonda cinque with a roadster variant that will only be produced in 5 units and command a $1.8 million price tag. carbon fiber is the name of the game with pagani cinque, with all body panels made of the light weight and strong material. the carbon fiber is on show as well, with many un painted sections all over the car, showing off the carbon weave proudly. the monocoque chassis which was engineered specifically for the cinque is of carbon-titanium construction, allowing the removal of the roof with no penalty to chassis stiffness and rigidity.
