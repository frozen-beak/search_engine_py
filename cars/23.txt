lamborghini is previewing their first full ev due in 2028 with the lanzador concept. positioned as a cross between an suv and a traditional coupe, the lanzador shares some of its looks with the urus and revuelto and should be very similar to how the production version will be styled in a few years time.
this concept has been fitted out with an electric powertrain consisting of two motors that combine for over 1 megawatt of power output (1,341 hp), and if the production car uses the volkswagen group’s ssp sport platform, that power figure could climb up to 1,700 hp+.
