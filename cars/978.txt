the first generation bmw m3 was based on the 1986 bmw 3-series e30, and although it looked very similar shared very little body panels â€“ only the hood and roof. it was powered by a specially developed 2.3 liter inline 4-cylinder engine producing 195 hp (143 kw) fitted with a 5-speed manual gearbox. this remarkable peace of engineering allowed the bmw m3 e30 to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 7.2 seconds and reach a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph).
the hand-build bmw m3 cabriolet was introduced in 1988 producing 215 hp (160 kw) and capable of reaching 239 km/h (148 mph) making it the fastest four-seater cabriolet at that time. with only 786 units ever produced is quite rare.
