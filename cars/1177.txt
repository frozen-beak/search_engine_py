mercedes is set to enter the world of electric cars with their eq branding, launching 10 cars by 2022 in this sub-brand. the concept eqa, is like the name suggests an a-class version of the eq electric version. the two door concept is another example of mercedes ‘sensual purity’ design idiom, reducing sharp edges and lines significantly, leaving a very well rounded and smooth form.
the electric powertrain has been built to be modular, with the possibility of more power being added to the system thanks to scalable battery components. the system uses 2 electric motors, permanent all-wheel drive and two drive programs called “sport” and “sport plus”, which offer different front to rear torque distribution.
