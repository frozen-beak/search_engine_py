a lightened, hard-edged racing variant of the standard diablo, the se 30 was sold in limited numbers during 1993 to celebrate lamborghini’s 30th anniversary.
in total just 150 cars were made, eight of which were right hand drive (rhd). also, lamborghini introduced the option of a “sports pack”, which, thanks to new air filters, produced an extra 75 bhp, bringing the total to 600 bhp. the only visual change to the car were two air scoops on top of the roof which helped force the air into the cylinders. only 10 were made in lhd and just 2 were rhd. one of the famous people to have owned an se 30 was jay kay (lead singer of jamiroquai).
the car went without most of the diablo’s standard equipment, meaning that it was devoid of a radio, air-conditioning or sound insulation and featured carbonfibre molded seats, helping to make it 125 kilograms lighter than the standard car. lamborghini choose to do without the vt’s advanced electronic suspension or all-wheel-drive systems, but the car did get an advanced adjustment system controlled with an interior dial that could instantaneously adjust the stiffness of the car’s front and rear anti-roll bars. they also enlarged the brake discs of all four wheels, but the car still lacked abs.
