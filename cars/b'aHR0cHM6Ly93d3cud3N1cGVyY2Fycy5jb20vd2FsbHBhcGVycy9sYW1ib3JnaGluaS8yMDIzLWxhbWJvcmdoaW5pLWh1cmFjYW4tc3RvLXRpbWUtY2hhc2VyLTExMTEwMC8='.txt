as lamborghini continue to celebrate their 60th anniversary, they have collaborated with japanese artist ikeuchi to create the huracan sto time chaser 111100. designed as a special one-off art piece, ikeuchi drew upon inspiration from past lamborghini anniversary cars like the countach 25th anniversary, the diablo se30, murcielago 40th and aventador lp 720-4 50th. it’s a little hard to tell exactly what parts were inspired by those past lamborghini’s, but we’ll take their word for it.
