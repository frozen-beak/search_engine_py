the 2019 monterey car week in california has played host to lamborghini’s special aventador s, which features artwork by street artist, skyler grey. often reffered to as the “fresh prince of street art”, 19 year old skyler grey has developed an iconic pop style that is often compared to artists like andy warhol, keith haring, and jean-michel basquiat.
katia bassi, chief marketing & communication officer of automobili lamborghini, commented: “because of the affinity we feel with the world of art, we wanted to experiment with a new creative approach, entrusting skyler grey with the interpretation of a car that is already itself a work of art. it is a project connected with our new paint shop in sant’agata bolognese, a place where technology and art meet and where our specialists are tasked with turning our customers’ dreams into reality, in the search for aesthetic perfection.”
