with the partnership between bugatti and the königliche porzellan-manufatur berlin (kpm) the renowned manufacturer emphasizes the ability in creating pieces of automotive art. the “l’or blanc” celebrates its world premiere with an exclusive unveiling ceremony on june 30, 2011 at the kpm workshops in berlin. this unique version of a bugatti veyron grand sport is the world’s first motor car to wear the finest porcelain on its body, as well as in its cabin. it captivates with an abstract exterior design.
the creation bears the name “l’or blanc.” it represents an automobile that redefines the art of design. if you look at it through the eyes of a designer, you will recognize that it is the reflection of the studio lights on the body that attracts their interest. positioned beneath a special light, the car is set in an ideal environment that provides an excellent image of the reflections. the studio light is reflected on the invisible edges between the body shapes of the grand sport. in numerous stages each reflection line is translated by bugatti’s designers onto the car body that has been pre-painted in a vibrant white tone. they use a precision tape made of japanese soft tissue that can be easily torn off by hand. it adheres perfectly to sulphur-containing plasticine. by stretching them to a certain degree, these tapes are “lined” in pieces up to five meters long across the whole exterior of the car.
