bmwâ€™s m4 convertible has returned for another generation, complete with fabric folding roof and all-wheel drive as standard. that fabric roof is 40 percent lighter than the previous generations folding hard-top, and takes only 18 seconds to fully lower or raise.
the powertrain is very familiar to the bmw family, with a turbocharged 3.0l s58 inline 6 cylinder engine feeding power through an eight-speed zf auto transmission. power and torque are rated the same as the m4 competition coupe, with 503 hp and 479 lb-ft respectively. performance is slightly behind the equivalent all-wheel drive m4 coupe, which is to be expected with the added weight of extra structural stiffening required when removing the roof.
