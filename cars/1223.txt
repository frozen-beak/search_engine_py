mercedes-amg g63 now comes with a 48v mild-hybrid system coupled to its twin turbo v8 engine for a little extra power and torque. the 4.0l v8 has remained unchanged, pumping out 577 hp and 627 lb-ft on its own, and the hybrid system can add a further 20 hp and 148 lb-ft into the mix. this is designed to come in at low speeds helping to reduce fuel consumption and slightly improve acceleration which now sits at 4.2 seconds for the 0-60 mph.
elsewhere, the g63 now has active hydraulic torsion bars and hydraulically-linked adaptive shock absorbers which all form part of the new amg active ride control system. this should improve comfort, off-road ability and handling along with better wheel-selective braking and torque management.
