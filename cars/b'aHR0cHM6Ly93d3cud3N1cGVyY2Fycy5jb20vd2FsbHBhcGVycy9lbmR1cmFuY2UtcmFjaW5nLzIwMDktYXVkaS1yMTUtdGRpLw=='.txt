audi wants to surprise the spectators at this year’s 24-hour race at le mans (france) with a progressive design: the audi design team created a fresh outfit for the innovative diesel race sports car that bears all the hallmarks of pleasure in efficiency.
whereas silver was the dominant color of the audi r15 tdi last year, the 2010 model boasts a radical new design that features more red. in addition, large areas of the le mans race sports car that is internally designated as “r15 plus” will be kept in a purist black carbon-fiber look.
“we’re happy that we were allowed to give the car such a progressive look,” say markus auerbach and tobias drews from the audi design team. “we wanted to add a dash of surprise when the audi leaves the pits at le mans. we practically opened up the bodywork and are exposing the light-weight construction and its uncompromising technical development – and with a little rock ’n’ roll for good measure.”
