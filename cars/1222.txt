mercedes-benz’s all-electric g is here, with four motors, plenty of torque and a complicated name. in what could be the start of mercedes moving away from their eq branding, they have decided not to call the electric g-class the eqg. instead, they opted for an awkward in the middle naming convention of mercedes-benz g580 with eq technology. very catchy.
in the transition to using electrons for propulsion, mercedes have fitted a total of four electric motors to the g580 which all combine to generate 579 hp and 859 lb-ft. that’s a lot of torque, torque which should come in very handy considering the hefty 7,716 lbs of weight this g wagon is lugging around.
