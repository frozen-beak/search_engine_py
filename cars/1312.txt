automotive fascination combined with spectacular racing car design – the new mercedes-benz sls amg gt3. this racing version of the gullwing model was designed as customer sports car for competing in race series according to the near-series fia gt3 rulebook. outstanding handling dynamics are ensured by uncompromising lightweight construction and specific modifications to the suspension, brakes and aerodynamics. this very special gullwing model will deliver its debut performance on the racetrack in 2011.
the purist design and breathtaking contours of this gullwing model are effectively emphasised by specific modifications to the bodywork. the new components made mainly from carbon-fibre are an unmistakable testimony to the outstanding racetrack performance and extensive aerodynamic development work.
at the front the gt3 racing car has a new front apron with larger air intakes: the wide aperture below the characteristic radiator grille with a large mercedes star and a wing-shaped transverse fin supplies the engine oil cooler and brake discs with cooling air. the two air intakes below the vertically arranged bi-xenon headlamps have the same function. downforce at the front axle is provided by four externally mounted “flics” and the carbon-fibre front splitter: this blends into the smooth underbody cladding which ends with the rear diffuser.
