the mercedes-benz slk 55 amg and the ducati streetfighter 848 complement each other not only visually but also technically. both models are the perfect embodiment of distinctive driving dynamics, expressive design and intense driving pleasure.
the slk 55 amg is the most powerful slk of all time. its newly developed amg 5.5-litre naturally aspirated v8 engine with cylinder shut-off system combines ultimate performance with the lowest possible consumption levels. with a maximum output of 422 hp and maximum toque of 540 nm, the slk55 amg outperforms all of its direct competitors. its fuel returns 33.6 mpg on the combind cycle and co2 emissions of 195 grams per kilometre are an improvement of 30 percent over that of its predecessor. the slk55 amg accelerates from 0-62 mph in just 4.6 seconds, and reaches a top speed of 155 mph (electronically limited). high levels of driving dynamics are ensured thanks to the amg sports suspension with direct-steer system, torque vectoring brakes and 3-stage esp®, as well as the amg high-performance braking system.
forming part of the third-generation of the slk, the new top-of-the range amg model already demonstrates its individuality even at first glance: distinctive amg light-alloy wheels, specific amg bodystyling with amg spoiler lip and two chrome-plated twin tailpipes at the rear complement the classic roadster proportions, while adding a markedly athletic touch. the expressive design of the slk 55 amg is both eye-catching and unmistakable.
