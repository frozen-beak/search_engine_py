porsche is expanding its range to include a whole new class of vehicle. the macan is the first porsche model to break into the compact suv segment and is poised to set new standards in the field of driving dynamics and enjoyment – on both paved streets and off-road terrain.
the porsche macan combines the typical handling characteristics that porsche has represented right from the outset: maximum acceleration and braking values, vast engine power, extreme agility and optimum steering precision. what’s more, all of these features are teamed with a high level of comfort and everyday suitability. the sporty dna of the macan, as with all porsche vehicles, is also immediately recognisable in the design. the sports utility vehicle is unrivalled in its flat and broad profile on the road. the wraparound bonnet and gently sloping roof line accentuate the overall impression of sporty elegance and powerful dynamics. many of the design elements have been taken from other porsche sportscars and enhanced for the macan, making it clear to see from the very first glance that the porsche macan heralds the first sportscar in the compact suv segment. the macan is “made in germany”, produced at the leipzig plant. porsche has invested 500 million euro in the plant and has established an entire production line there. the line is set up to produce around 50,000 vehicles per year – all manufactured with the utmost precision and to the highest level of quality. just what you would expect from porsche.
