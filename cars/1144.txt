for the first time, there is an amg sports package for the 2010 mercedes-benz cl-class. with revamped amg bodystyling, attractive 19-inch amg light-alloy wheels and special interior details, both top mercedes-benz models can now be made more striking than ever in terms of sportiness. the appealing combination of exclusive equipment features, many of which are not available separately, is proving increasingly popular with customers. the amg sports package is now available for five mercedes model types.
new amg bodystyling, including a front apron with large air intakes, enhances the visual impact of the s-class and the cl-class. the rear apron with a striking black insert and integrated, rectangular tailpipe trim in polished stainless steel is also eye-catching. amg side sill panels round off the amg bodystyling. 19-inch amg light-alloy wheels with a five-spoke design and wide-base 255/40 (front) and 275/40 (rear) tyres fill the wheel arches perfectly and provide optimum contact with the road. 20-inch amg light-alloy wheels are available as an option in a twin-spoke design with 255/35 and 275/35 tyres. mounted on the front axle there are perforated brake discs and silver-painted brake callipers featuring mercedes-benz lettering; the v6 models have a more generously proportioned braking system.
