lamborghini’s huracán successor has arrived, it’s called the temerario and its hybrid v8 screams up to 10,000 rpm. unveiled at the 2024 monterey car week in california, the all-new lamborghini temerario replaces the much-loved huracán in the italian brands supercar line-up. 
like its big brother the revuelto, lamborghini have gone down the hybrid electrification route for the temerario opting for a smaller displacement 4.0l twin turbo v8 engine coupled with three electric motors. the v8 on its own will develop 789 hp, a huge 158 hp more than the most powerful huracán before it. it features a flat-plane crank, titanium conrods, two big turbochargers feeding up to 36 psi of boost and a redline of 10,000 rpm. 
then when we add in those three e-motors (two mounted on the front axle and the third fitted between the engine and transmission) the peak power output rises up to 907 hp with 538 lb-ft of torque.
