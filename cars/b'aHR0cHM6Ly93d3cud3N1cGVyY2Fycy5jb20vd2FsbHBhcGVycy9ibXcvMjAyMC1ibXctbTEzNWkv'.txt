fresh off the production line is the new third generation bmw 1-series, with the 300+ horsepower m135i taking it’s place as the top of the range. whilst once based off a shortened 3-series platform the 1-series now gets it’s very own chassis, but loses a key ingredient in the process. that ingredient is the removal of the rear-wheel drive setup bmw’s are so well known for. the front-wheel drive layout has been chosen for more ideal packaging and increased interior space, but has robbed the 1-series some of it’s dynamic appeal. the m135i does get bmw’s xdrive all-wheel drive as standard, though it is a front-wheel biased system much like a haldex design only sending a maximum of 50% power to the rear wheels.
propulsion is provided by bmw’s b48 four-cylinder petrol engine, which is a 2.0l unit and features a twin-scroll turbocharger to boost power output. that peak power is rated at 306 ps (225 kw), which is available from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm. peak torque is a beefy 332 lb-ft (450 nm) between 1,750 and 4,500 rpm. those figures put the m135i in the same ball park as the mercedes-amg a35 and volkswagen golf r, comfortably beating both of them with it’s torque figure whilst shading the golf in power, and equaling the mercedes.
