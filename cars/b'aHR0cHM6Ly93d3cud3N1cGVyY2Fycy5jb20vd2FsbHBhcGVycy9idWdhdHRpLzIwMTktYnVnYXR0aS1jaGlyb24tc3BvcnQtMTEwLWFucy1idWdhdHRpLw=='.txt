bugatti are celebrating it’s 110th anniversary by making a limited edition bugatti chiron sport ‘110 ans bugatti’. the design a based around the colours of the french flag, with a matte ‘steel blue’ finish on the bodywork completed by a set of bright blue, white and red stripes on the underside of the airbrake. the intention is to underline the companies french roots in molsheim.
performance remains unchanged, with the mighty w16 powerplant from the chiron sport still pumping out huge power. pricing is expected to exceed the £2.36m of the regular chiron sport, and with only 20 examples set for production, the ‘110 ans bugatti’ should sell out quick.
