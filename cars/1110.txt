bmw have given the z4 roadster a nip and tuck for the 2023 model refresh. none of the mechanicals underneath the skin have changed with the z4 maintaining it’s the 50:50 weight distribution and short wheelbase/wide track stance. what has changed it the choice of engines goes down to two, with a 2.0l inline 4 turbo, or the more powerful 3.0l inline 6 turbo.
visually the 2023 z4 remains mostly the same as well, with a new wheel design, three new colour options and a tweaking of the front facia kidney grilles and outer intake openings being the only changes. this may be the last time a new z4 model is released, with bmw likely to discontinue the model in a few years.
