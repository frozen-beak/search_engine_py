the bmw group has chosen the 2016 paris motor show to present the bmw concept x2. this new addition to the compact segment has a distinctive design that stands apart from that of the other x models and also draws on the bmw group’s history of coupe-making. the result is a compact concept exuding urban sporting appeal.
the design of the bmw concept x2 fuses apparent contradictions into a single coherent statement. “the bmw concept x2 combines the fast-moving body language and low-slung proportions of a coupe with the robust construction of an x model. this is a sporty vehicle with a bold character, and it allows us to open up some fascinating new design possibilities for the bmw brand,” says karim habib, head of bmw design.
the distinctive character of the bmw concept x2 already shines through in the car’s proportions. while its large wheels and familiar two-box design underline its functional x model character, a long wheelbase, stretched roofline, short overhangs and heavily forward-slanting c-pillar give the body a sporty, low-to-the-road feel. the interplay of the darker cladding surfaces and striking luminous red body colour make the concept x2 look even slimmer from the side.
