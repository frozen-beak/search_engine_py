lamborghini and pirelli have had a long and successful partnership dating back to the beginning of lamborghini in 1963, with every car since equipped with pirelli tires. this partnership is based on more than the two firms italian origins, with a shared quest for technological innovation driving their commitment. the aventador pirelli edition will be available in both coupe and roadster variants and be a limited edition run.
colour choices consist of a matte black top section that consists of the roof, the pillars, the rear-view mirrors, the engine hood, and the front, rear, side and moving air intakes, alongside contrasting glossy finishes for the rest of the body (giallo spica, rosso mars, bianco isis, nero aldebaran, grigio liqueo, and grigio ater). alternatively, the opposite can be had with a glossy black top section and matte finish for the rest of the exterior.
special pirelli branding comes in the form of a thin red line that starts at the rear of the car with the pirelli logo and traces its way up the roof pillar on both sides. a red pirelli logo is also present on the p zero tires. the red stripe is continued in the interior running along the interior ceiling and the seats, which feature the lamborghini and pirelli crests embroidered in red.
