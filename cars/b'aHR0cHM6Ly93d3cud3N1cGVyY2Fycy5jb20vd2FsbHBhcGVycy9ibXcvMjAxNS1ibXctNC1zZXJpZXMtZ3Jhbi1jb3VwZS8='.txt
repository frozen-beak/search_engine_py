bmw proudly presents the new bmw 4-series gran coupé, the first four-door coupé in the premium midsize class that represents a consistent extension of the model range. the new bmw 4-series gran coupé combines the sleek look of a two-door coupé with the functionality provided by four-doors and expansive spaciousness, including a wide-access luggage compartment.
the bmw 4-series gran coupé has exactly the same dimensions as the two-door coupé: a length of 4,638 millimeters, a width of 1,825 millimeters and a wheelbase of 2,810 millimeters. up front, both models are identical and share the typical bmw design features like the double-kidney grille, dual round headlights and the large air intake in the front apron. however, the roof of the bmw 4-series gran coupé is twelve millimeters higher, 112 mm longer and gently stretched allowing it to flow smoothly into the rear quarter panels and boot lid. the typical bmw short overhangs, the long bonnet and the set-back passenger compartment complement the design of the bmw 4-series gran coupé to express perfect balance combined with a bold presence.
this extended roofline highlights the elegance and sophistication of the bmw 4-series gran coupé, while setting new standards for aesthetics in the midsize class that also have decisive practical advantages.
