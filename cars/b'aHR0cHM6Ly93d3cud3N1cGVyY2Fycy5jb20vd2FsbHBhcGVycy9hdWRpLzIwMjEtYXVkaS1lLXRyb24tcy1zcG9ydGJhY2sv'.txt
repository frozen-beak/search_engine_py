audi have launched their first high performance ev in the form of the e-tron s. the extra performance has been gained with the introduction of a third electric motor, which moves the bigger of the three onto the front axle and and smaller two on the rear. the e-tron’s weight should be increased some what as the extra electric motor will tip the scales in the wrong direction. already a heavy suv, which comes with the same large 95 kwh battery pack, the e-tron s certainly doesn’t show any effects on the spec sheet.
acceleration has improved by a fair amount, with the 0-62 mph sprint now completed in just 4.5 seconds, coming down from the regular e-tron’s 5.7 seconds. this is thanks to not only more power, which is up 95 ps tp 503 ps (370 kw), but a lot more torque. that peak torque figure has raised from 487 lb-ft to 717 lb-ft, providing plenty of push to move all that weight. top speed has also gone up slightly, from 124 mph to a new high of 130 mph.
as with all audi s cars, the visual changing have made the e-tron look a little more sporty and aggressive, with bigger wheels, bigger vent openings and more pronounced styling. whilst the regular e-tron looked like any run of the mill suv, the s version, especially the sportback variant hints at being a much more serious performer.
