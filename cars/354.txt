porsche have revealed their most extreme 911 gt3 rs yet, with aero straight from their motorsport program. fair to say this is pushing the limits of a track focused road car with the most aggressive aero package we’ve seen yet on a 911 gt3.
with so many new parts to play with the gt3 rs is actually a little heavier than the regular gt3 despite the liberal use of carbon fibre. to help compensate, porsche has given the rs a little extra power bump taking the new total up to 517 hp. this is thanks to a new cam profile, single-throttle intake system and rigid valve drive taken from porsche’s race cars. the only transmission option is a seven-speed pdk with a shorter final drive.
