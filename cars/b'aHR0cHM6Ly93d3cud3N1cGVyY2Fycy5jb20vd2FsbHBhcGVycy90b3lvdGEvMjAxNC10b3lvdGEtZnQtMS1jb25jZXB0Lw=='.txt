the name says it all. ft-1 stands for “future toyota,” and the number “1” represents the ultimate. according to its designers at calty design research, the ft-1 concept is the ultimate expression of a toyota coupe design, building upon toyota’s rich sports coupe heritage dating back to the 2000gt, celica, supra, mr2 and most recently scion fr-s. in addition, the concept draws inspiration from calty’s more recent sports car concept work such as ft-hs (2007) and the lexus lf-lc (2012).
the ft-1’s audacious design represents the pinnacle of calty’s 40th year of operation. guided by the toyota design ethos of vibrant clarity, a unique fusion of both emotional and rational factors that delivers a more exciting and dramatic design expression with unique toyota identity, the concept is a spiritual pace car for toyota global design. the goal of this ideological shift is to develop future generations of products that better connect emotionally with toyota’s global consumer base.
the front engine rear-wheel drive configuration locates the cockpit far rearward within the wheelbase to improve weight distribution. this design element also helps create the classic sportscar proportions one would expect from a vehicle poised to dominate even the most challenging road course. the cockpit’s wraparound windshield and side glass openings are a distinct nod to the design of the legendary toyota 2000gt.
