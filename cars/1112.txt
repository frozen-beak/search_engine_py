shown off at the 2017 concours d’elegance, bmw’s new z4 concept car offers a look ahead to the series-production version set to be unveiled during 2018. the new z4 concept continues the same visual language bmw has been refining for the last few years with their concept car designs. short over hangs, large wheels with a low-slung stance and a driving position more centered than previous bmw roadsters, provide a good looking, well balanced silhouette. the styling is accentuated by the dome structures set behind the seats, helping to further balance out the transition to the rear of the car, whilst also acting as the roll cage.
“the bmw concept z4 in an all-out driving machine,” said adrian van hooydonk, senior vice president bmw group design. “stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. this is total freedom on four wheels. the bmw concept z4 expresses the new bmw design language from all perspectives and in all details. from the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion.”
