the panamera sport turismo unites the next generation hybrid drive with new ideas for an evolutionary, sporty body concept; it combines porsche performance with comprehensive everyday practicality.
the body concept of the porsche panamera sport turismo is an outlook on a possible porsche sports car of tomorrow: the overhangs are short, and the boot lid is large – both sporty and functional. the concept car combines the dimensions of a premium vehicle with the interior comfort of the luxury class. the sport turismo is 1,990 mm wide, a low 1,401 mm in height and 4,950 mm long. its direction indicators and sidelights are integrated in c-shaped lighting units – known as c-blades – mounted in the large air inlets at the front end. together with four-point led headlights in an innovative design, they define the front end appearance of the concept car.
the smooth and taut exterior skin is not interrupted by add-on parts – there are no conventional exterior mirrors. in their place, the sport turismo has two cameras mounted in the side air outlets whose images are shown on the displays in the cockpit. the rear body has been completely reshaped, yet it retains all of the characteristics of a porsche. the rear lights in led technology and the tail-light panel with the “porsche” badge are sculpted in three dimensions, and the brake light is positioned between the four-point led rear lights. forming the roof termination is an adaptive carbon rear spoiler that produces improved downforce.
