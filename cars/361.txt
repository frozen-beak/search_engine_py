the 4.0l flat 6 engine remains largely the same as the production version, with direct fuel injection that operates at pressures up to 200 bar, and variable valve timing adjustments of the intake and exhaust camshafts for fuel efficiency. changes to the engine have delivered significantly better driveability with a broader usable rev range, and thanks to the use of six throttle butterflies engine response is more precise. the transmission is a sequential six-speed constant-mesh unit that uses an electronic shift actuator for fast precise gear changes.
