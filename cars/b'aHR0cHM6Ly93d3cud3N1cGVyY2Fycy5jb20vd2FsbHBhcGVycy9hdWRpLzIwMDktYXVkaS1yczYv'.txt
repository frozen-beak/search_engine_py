the second generation rs 6 was based on the volkswagen group c6 platform, with 8,000 units made over it’s lifetime and 6,500 of those were the avant versions. this car went head to head with the bmw m5 and mercedes e63 amg, out doing them both in the pure power figures, but was only available with a much higher price tag than the others.
the v10 engine was a close relation to the v10’s used in the audi r8 & lamborghini gallardo with a key difference of having 2 turbochargers stuck on. this provided the rs6 with some impressive power numbers of 571 hp and 479 lb-ft, and made it the most powerful audi production car at the time. power is sent through a 6-speed tiptronic auto to all four wheels via audi’s quattro system.
visually the rs6 took the look of the s6 and added flared wheel arches to allow for a wider wheel track, and utilised bigger air dams to feed the intercoolers and radiators.
