just like the legendary original porsche 911 targa model, the new model features the characteristic wide bar in place of the b-pillars, a movable roof section above the front seats and a wraparound rear window with no c-pillar. but unlike the classic models, the roof segment on the new targa can be opened and closed at the push of a button. when the button is actuated, the fully automatic roof system stows the convertible top behind the rear seat system, providing a real spectacle. the rear-weighted design of the ptm all-wheel drive is a typical porsche feature, and guarantees that this latest 911 model also offers optimum driving dynamics on all road surfaces and in all weather conditions.
with these features, the new porsche 911 targa is presenting itself as a high-quality, innovative remake of the classic vehicle from 1965. the model shares a great deal in common with the 911 carrera 4 cabriolet models; up to the window line, the technology and body of the vehicles is more or less the same. the combination of the wide rear end that is typical of all-wheel drive models, the targa bar and the dome-shaped rear window gives the latest 911 an extremely sporty appearance and a low-slung profile.
