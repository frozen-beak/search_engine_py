the new toyota ft-86 ii concept makes its world debut at the 2011 geneva motor show, giving the clearest indication yet as to the final design of toyota’s next sports car. it marks a return to the passion for driving that has inspired great toyota cars of the past, starting with the legendary 2000 gt in the 1960s.
with its long, low bonnet, high wings and rear-set cabin, the toyota ft-86 ii concept pays homage to toyota’s sports car history and is an entirely driver-oriented concept. it was created at toyota’s european design studio ed2, where its styling was dubbed ‘functional beauty’: its bold, sweeping form has been generated purely according to the constraints of function and aerodynamics.
rather than using a heavy, large displacement powertrain to secure performance, the ft-86 ii returns to toyota’s sporting roots by combining a free-revving boxer petrol engine with a compact and lightweight six-speed manual transmission and a low centre of gravity to achieve the best possible power to weight ratio.
