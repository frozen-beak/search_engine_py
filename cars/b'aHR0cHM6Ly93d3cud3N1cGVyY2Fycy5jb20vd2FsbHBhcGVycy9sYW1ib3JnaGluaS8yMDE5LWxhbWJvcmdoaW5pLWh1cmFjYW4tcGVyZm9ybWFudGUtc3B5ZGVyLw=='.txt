the fastest baby lamborghini now lets you put the roof down and experience over 200 mph with the wind rushing through your hair. the huracan performante set the record for fastest production car lap time at the nurburgring when it was released displaying incredible control and agility. expect the spyder to be no different, with the active aero package remaining and all the power from the engine staying the same as well.
as is usually the case when the roof is removed some extra weight has been added, at around 125 kilograms in total. this does have the effect of stifling the performance numbers a little bit, but the car is so impressive that most mortals would tell the difference on the road. 0-100 kph has risen a couple of tenths to 3.1 seconds, and 0-200 kph take four tenths longer at 9.3 seconds. the upside to the extra weight and slower performance is the chance to experience the glorious sounding v10 in the back.
