breathtakingly sporty proportions and a powerfully dynamic design idiom with sensuously shaped surfaces already made the cla unmistakable in its four-door coupé guise. it is now followed by a further design icon, the cla shooting brake, with a unique look all of its own. the lower overall height and the elongated coupé-style roof contour line, the low greenhouse and the sweep of the high beltline are the key design features of its distinctive profile. as is the gentle downward slope of the roof line, which makes for significantly more headroom than in the four-door coupé.
the guiding principle behind the designers’ work was that of sensual purity as an expression of modern luxury. “the new cla shooting brake offers a contemporary interpretation of sensual purity and represents the perfect synthesis between the emotionality of a coupé and the intelligence of a shooting brake,” explains gorden wagener, head of design at daimler ag. “the styling of our cla shooting brake is extremely progressive as well as unmistakable. once again, we have created a whole new class of vehicle.”
