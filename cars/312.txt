audi’s s8 has been given a light refresh and is set to be the brands last combustion engined s8. that engine is the same 4.0l twin turbocharged v8 from the previous s8, producing 563 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque. it provides strong performance for the s8, enabling a 0-62 mph sprint time of 3.8 seconds. but electric propulsion will be the future for audi’s a8 range as the luxury long wheelbase market favours comfortable and quiet motoring, something electric vehicles are usually very good at.
