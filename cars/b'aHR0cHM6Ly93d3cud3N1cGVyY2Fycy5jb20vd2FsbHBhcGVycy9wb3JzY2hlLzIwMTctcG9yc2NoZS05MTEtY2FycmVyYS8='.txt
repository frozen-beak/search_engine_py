the porsche 911 has been the world’s best-selling sports car for decades. now the new generation has arrived to further extend this lead. with innovative turbo flat engines, an advanced chassis with an even greater spread between performance and comfort and a new infotainment system it is exceedingly well-equipped for this. thanks to more than four decades of experience with turbo engines – in both motor racing and production sports cars – the new engines in the new 911 carrera set benchmarks in terms of performance, driving pleasure and efficiency. the rear-axle steering available as an option for the carrera models for the first time further greatly extends the range of driving dynamics.
exterior features of the 911 carrera have been visually refined: these range from new headlights with four-point daytime running lights to door handles without recess covers, a redesigned rear lid with vertical louvres and new rear lights – including the characteristic four-point brake lights. in the interior the new standard porsche communication management with a multi-touch display offers a considerably expanded range of functions and greatly simplified operation.
