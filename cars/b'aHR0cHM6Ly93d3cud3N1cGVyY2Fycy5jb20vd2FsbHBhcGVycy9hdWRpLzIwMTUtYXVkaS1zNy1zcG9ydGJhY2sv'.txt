audi has spared no effort in revising the a7 sportback. the spacious five-door coupe is now even more powerful and attractive â€“ thanks to new engine configurations, new transmissions, new headlights, taillights and new infotainment systems. the new a7 sportback combines the emotional appeal and sportiness of a coupe with the comfort of a sedan and the functional benefits of an avant.
back when the a7 sportback first debuted in 2010, audi was already setting new standards in automotive design, embracing an athletic aesthetic and elegance in grand style. its long engine hood, sporty, flowing c-pillars and the sharply dropping rear end create a dynamic overall impression. the revised version of the five-door model, measuring 4.97 meters (16.3 ft) in length, now has additional striking, sporty features.
the most striking changes are to the singleframe grille, bumpers, tailpipes and headlights. led technology is now standard; upon request, audi can supply matrix led headlights, which light the road optimally without causing glare for other road users. combined with the matrix led headlights, dynamic turn signals are also installed at the front; they come standard at the rear.
