no other car lives up to the standards so famously set by company founder gottlieb daimler quite as comprehensively as the top model from mercedes-benz. the mercedes-benz s600 with v12 biturbo engine is the top model in the already successfully established s-class and is available exclusively with long wheelbase and with a luxurious package of equipment and appointments. its performance data: 390 kw / 530 hp and 830 nm of torque.
the figure “600” has long been a legend in the history of the automobile: the model 600 (w 100) launched in 1963 was the first passenger car from mercedes-benz to feature a v8 injection engine. this same powerful (184 kw/250 hp) and refined engine was also used from 1967 on in the w 109 model series (in the top-of-the-range 300 sel 6.3). further top models to feature a v8 engine included the 450 sel 6.9 from the model series 116 (210 kw/286 hp) and the 560 se in the 126 series (220 kw/300 hp in the ece version). the 600 se model in the 140 model series of 1991 marked the introduction of the first twelve-cylinder engine as standard in a mercedes-benz passenger car. the m 120 delivered 300 kw / 408 hp from a displacement of 6 litres and began a tradition of v12 units as the top-of-the-range engines in the s-class. since the 220 series, mercedes-benz has also offered especially sporty, amg-optimised variants with v8 and v12 engines at the top of its s-class range, in the form of the s 63 amg and s 65 amg.
