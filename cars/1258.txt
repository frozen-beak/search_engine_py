the grand finale: the mercedes-benz sls amg gt final edition brings an impressive era to an end in exclusive style. the final edition model, built in a limited run of just 350 units, represents the last opportunity for customers to order a sls amg – while at the same time reflecting the unrivalled success story and unique scope offered by the first vehicle to be completely built by mercedes-amg. the super sports car, with its 435 kw / 591 hp amg 6.3-litre v8 front-mid engine, offers a fascinating combination of truly exceptional design and equipment features. exclusively developed cup tyres enhance its dynamic performance.
the mercedes-benz sls amg gt final edition is celebrating its twin world premiere at the 2013 los angeles auto show and the 2013 tokyo motor show. the market launch will begin in march 2014. the super sports car will be available as either a coupé or a roadster and, once 350 units have been built, production of the sls amg model series will come to an end.
