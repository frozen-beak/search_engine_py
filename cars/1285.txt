new limited run mercedes-amg sl63 gets f1 inspired livery and lots of goodies as standard. the two-tone livery design consists of a gradient that transitions from high-tech silver at the front, to obsidian black at the rear. petronas green accents are present on the sills, diffuser and front bumper, and a three-pointed star pattern fades in towards the rear of the car. all up the l63 motorsport collectors edition celebrates the 2022 formula 1 car and looks a lot like the amg one hypercar.
