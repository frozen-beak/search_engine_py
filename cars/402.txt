a one-off porsche 911 speedster ‘sonderwunsch’ fills in the missing gap of a 993 generation speedster. commissioned by italian-born industrial designer and architect luca trazzi, the sonderwunsch (which translates to special request) takes a 993 porsche 911 and give it the speedster treatment with a chopped off roof. only two 993 speedsters have been built before, both as special orders like this one, with one built for ferdinand alexander porsche in 1995 and the other for jerry seinfeld in 2001.
powered by the 3.8l flat 6 air-cooled engine from the 993 carrera rs, the sonderwunsch makes 296 hp, wears pinstriped 18-inch turbo wheels and is finished with a bright otto yellow paint job. starting life as a 1994 911 cabriolet, the engineers had to shorten the windscreen and change the rear deck to the more bulbous looking design the speedster is known for. porsche have said that there will more special on-off builds in the future, following the industry trend that the likes of ferrari have been doing for years.
