bugatti have created one of the most expensive one-off bespoke cars in the world called the bugatti la voiture noire. built using a regular bugatti chiron, this bespoke commission built in-house by bugatti, takes inspiration from the bugatti type 57sc atlantic, perhaps the most celebrated car in the companies history.
the bugatti la voiture noire features some striking design features including six, yes six rear tail pipes all lined up in a row. sitting above them is a single rear light bar that stretches the entire width of the car and takes on the flowing form of the rear haunches. there is also the raised centreline that starts at the front grill and continues over the roof ending at the active rear spoiler. this line features an accented colour highlighting the design element that takes it’s cues from the type 57sc atlantic. on that car the raised ridge was due to the prototype’s magnesium alloy construction that used a riveted and not seam-welded construction. the c-motif design found on the side of the chiron has taken the form similar to the divo, and the front has gained a bigger flared grill and large air vents.
