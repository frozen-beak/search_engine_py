mercedes g-class is going electric, fulfilling the promise made to arnold schwarzenegger by daimler chair dieter zetsche in 2018. that was when the all-new g wagon was released and came as a surprise to many as the rugged utilitarian appearance of the g always seemed to be more of an internal combustion engine car.
when it goes on sale sometime in 2022, it will sell alongside the gas-powered version for the immediate future at least. the concept eqg looks very similar to the regular g-class, with some differences in the digital front grille, lower grille mesh and 22-inch wheels. there is also extra exterior lighting on offer with the side rub strips now illuminated with led’s, and a large roof mounted rack sporting a wide led light front and back.
