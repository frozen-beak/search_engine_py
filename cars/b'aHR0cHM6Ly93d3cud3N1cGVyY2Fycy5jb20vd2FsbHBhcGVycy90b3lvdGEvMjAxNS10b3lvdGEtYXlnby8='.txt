new aygo was designed to seduce. the design theme was dubbed ‘j-playful’. it takes its inspiration from contemporary japanese youth-culture, which favours strong and outspoken shapes and forms.
compact packaging was fundamental to the demands of new aygo’s largely urban-based customers. the overall length has increased by just 25 mm to 3,455 mm, maintaining new aygo’s class leading compactness. despite a 7 mm increase in front headroom, vehicle height was reduced by 5 mm for aerodynamic efficiency. and the track was widened by 8 mm at both the front and rear to improve vehicle stance.
this solidity comes from a strong mono-form which provides the overall volume of the design. in order to add a playful character, the concept was based on the expansion of a soft object within this rigid structure. as it bursts through the hard shell, it creates break lines and forms the aygo’s bold frontal ‘x’ graphic. this spreads outwards across the surface of the bodywork, and contains all the vehicle’s key components, including upper and lower grilles, headlamps, foglamps, and even mirrors and side glazing.
