celica, mr2, supra, corolla ae86: toyota’s great driver-focused sports cars of the past have inspired its vision for a future-generation concept model that makes its european debut at the geneva motor show. the ft-86 sports concept previews a new-generation toyota sports car, designed to recapture the spirit of the ae86, sharing its front-engine, rear-wheel drive credentials.
in creating the ft-86 (future toyota-86) sports concept, toyota has directly referenced the excitement and fundamental fun-to-drive quality that characterised the corolla ae-86. in its day the ae86 became a must-have model for rallying and circuit racing, with its front-engine, rear-wheel drive powertrain, compact dimensions, light weight, impeccable balance and strong power to weight ratio. even more than 20 years on from the end of production, it remains a popular choice with privateer rally teams.
