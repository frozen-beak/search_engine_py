updated styling and technology headline the mercedes-amg e53 for 2021, as the mid range amg e-class gets freshened up. the mild hybrid powertrain in the e53 has remained the same, producing 435 ps (320 kw) of peak power and 384 lb-ft (520 nm) of torque. mercedes 4matic+ all-wheel-drive system is present to help with traction, and a nine-speed automatic transmission has been chosen to handle gear selection. itâ€™s worth noting that this transmission is a conventional torque converter model, and not the same wet-clutch automatic found in the v8 powered e63.
the visual restyling in minor overall but includes thinner headlights, a reshaped lower section of the front bumper and revised front grille. at the rear the lights and bumper styling has been tweaked, whilst the side profile remains unchanged. all typical face lift stuff.
