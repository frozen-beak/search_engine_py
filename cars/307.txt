audi new 600 horsepower 4-door coupe rs7 has broken cover at the 2019 frankfurt motor show. utilising the same twin turbo 4.0l v8 as the recently launched rs6 avant, the rs7 shares much of the same dna as it’s brother. as with all audi sport rs models, the new rs7 sportback features a more aggressive appearance package with a large single piece front grill and wider air intakes. the wheels are a unique design to the rs7 for the 22-inch options, more regular 21-inch wheels come standard.
that powerful 600 ps (441 kw) v8 engine is equipped with audi’s now customary 48-volt mild-hybrid system, allowing the car to coast between 34 and 99 mph with the engine off for short periods. the eight-speed tiptronic gearbox is the only transmission on the table, and is complmented by audi’s quattro four-wheel drive. the mechanical centre differential gives a 40:60 torque split front to back, with the ability to send up to 80 per cent to either the front or rear wheels. 0-100 kph acceleration is clocked at 3.6 seconds, matching the rs6 avant. top speed has been limited to 155 mph, with the option of raising it to 177 mph for the dynamic pack and 190mph with the dynamic plus pack.
