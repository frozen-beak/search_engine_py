the new 2.5 tfsi outputs 294 kw (400 hp) – 33 hp more than its predecessor. that makes it the most powerful five-cylinder engine on the world market. its 480 nm (354.0 lb-ft) of torque is available at engine speeds between 1,700 and 5,850 revolutions per minute for outstanding tractive power. the compact rs model sprints from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in just 4.1 seconds. it can attain a maximum speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph); on request audi will increase the electronically limited top speed to 280 km/h (174.0 mph). the unique sound of the five-cylinder unit intensifies an already emotionally charged driving experience. its sound comes from having the ignition alternate between directly adjacent cylinders and widely spaced ones. the sound can be modified via audi drive select.
