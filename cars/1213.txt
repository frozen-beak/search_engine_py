the silver arrows has returned as mercedes-amg unveil their all new 2022 formula 1 challenger. after running with the striking black livery for the last couple of years, mercedes have reverted to their historical silver based colour scheme. 
those viewers who are keen eyed will notice there are two very different w13’s in these wallpapers, as merc has chosen to hide many of the real cars details in the official renders. you can play a game of spot the difference between the renders and the real thing.
2022 will see young british driver george russell take a seat at mercedes alongside seven time world champ lewis hamilton. hamilton has returned after the controversial end to the 2021 season that saw him lose the drivers championship on the final lap. russell has replaced valtteri bottas and will face the challenge of competing against one of the best drivers of all time. considering the potential russell has shown to date, pushing hamilton will go a long way to proving he has what it takes.
