the first in a line of potent audi rs6â€™s started life with a twin turbocharged v8 that cranked out 444 horsepower. now the rs6 is known for nailing the powerful family wagon formula, but back in 2002, audi were only just starting to tap into this mindset. the start of that journey can be traced back to the original audi rs car, the rs2, a joint venture between audi and porsche that ended up being one of the great wagons.
audi went all out for their first rs6, developing an all-new brake system to handle the increased speeds the car had to deal with. they also fitted an innovative suspension concept for the time called dynamic ride control (drc), which was essentially an adaptive damper setup.
