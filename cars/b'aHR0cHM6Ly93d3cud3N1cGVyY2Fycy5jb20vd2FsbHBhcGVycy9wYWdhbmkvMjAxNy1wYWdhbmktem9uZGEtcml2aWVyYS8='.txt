that’s right the seemingly endless one-off pagani zondas are still appearing with the newest addition called the riviera, and it’s a stunner. this version has just been delivered to exotic car dealership seven car lounge in saudi arabi. the car uses the same power specification as the other members of the zonda 760 family, which all make use of the amg sourced 7.3l v12 engine.
the styling of the zonda riviera harks back to the zonda cinque with the roof scoop, large rear wing, shark fin, and aggressive diffuser dominating the look. the paint work is what really sets the riviera apart, with striking blue accent pinstripes on the wheels, down the sides and running the length of the car down the centre. the paint work is finished off with a pearl white and carbon fibre mix.
