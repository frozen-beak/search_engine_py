the porsche 959s is the more powerful, limited edition version of the 1980’s fastest production car. boasting 517 ps (380 kw) of power and 414 lb-ft (561 nm) of torque from the 2.8l flat 6 engine, the 959s was capable of sprinting from 0-62 mph  in just 3.5 seconds. that was seriously quick back in the 80’s, and the 211 mph top speed made the 959 one of the fastest cars of the era. the extra power and torque meant the 959s was officially an 11 second quarter mile car, being able to complete a pass in 11.8 seconds at a trap speed of 119 mph.
production was limited to only 29 units for 959s, making it a rare version of an already rare car. whilst the regular porsche 959 remained refined and comfortable despite it’s performance credentials, the s version sort to provide a more focused experience. a full roll cage was fitted, sports seats replaced the comfy factory sets and racing seat belts were installed to make sure occupants weren’t going anywhere. and the suspension was tuned to race specification in an effort to improve handling and road holding. upon entering the 959s, drivers knew this was a more track focused supercar.
