the e36 m3 debuted in february 1992 and was in the dealer’s showrooms in november that year. it was the first m3 powered by a straight-six engine; the engine used was a 2,990 cc (182 cu in) s50, which produced 210 kw (282 hp).
initially available as a coupé only, bmw introduced m3 convertible and saloon versions in 1994, the absence of any m5 models in the bmw line-up between the end of e34 m5 production in 1995 and the launch of the e39 m5 in 1998 prompted the introduction of the 4-door motorsport model.
also in 1994, bmw produced the limited-edition m3 gt as a racing homologation special; all gts were british racing green and featured an upgraded 295 ps (217 kw; 291 hp) 3.0-litre engine. 356 gts were built.
