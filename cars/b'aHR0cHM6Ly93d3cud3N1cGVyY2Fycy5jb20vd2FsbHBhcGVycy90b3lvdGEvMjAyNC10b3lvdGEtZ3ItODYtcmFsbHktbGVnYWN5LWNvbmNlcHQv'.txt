toyota’s gr 86 rally legacy concept channels the look of the celica gt-four rally car whilst using the heart of the gr corolla. headed for the 2024 sema show, this concept is giving off real sega rally vibes with the retro white with red and green livery toyota were famous for using on their rally cars. but this isn’t just a bit of paintwork, toyota have swapped out the gr 86’s usual 2.4l flat 4 engine and replaced it with the turbocharged 1.6l inline 3 engine from the gr corolla. it also gets the corolla’s trick all-wheel-drive system, a custom suspension setup and race-ready interior.
