audi have given the rs4 a mild refresh for 2020 improving on an already strong package with subtle new styling touches. not much has changed from the 2018 audio rs4 with the same 2.9l twin turbocharged v6 found under the hood. power and torque have remained the same as well, with 420 ps (309 kw) of peak power and 442 lb-ft (599 nm) of torque between 1,900 and 5,000 rpm.
power is sent through an eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission and on to the usual quattro all-wheel-drive system. the centre differential uses a mechanical multi-clutch setup with a 40:60 front to rear split that can be send up to 85 percent of power to the rear wheels under the right circumstances. the front wheel can receive up to 75 percent when they need it, and an optional rear quattro sport differential can be fitted to portion torque to individual rear wheels.
