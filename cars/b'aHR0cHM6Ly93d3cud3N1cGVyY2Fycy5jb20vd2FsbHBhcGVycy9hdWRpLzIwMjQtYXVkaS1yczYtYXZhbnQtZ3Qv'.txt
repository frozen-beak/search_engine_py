celebrating its 40th anniversary, audi sport have released the limited edition rs6 gt inspired by a legendary race car from the 80â€™s. that race car is the 90 quattro imsa gto, a 700 plus horsepower, all-wheel drive monster which was essentially a word rally car underneath. buyers will be able to option a red, black and grey on white livery with the rs6 gt that follows a very similar style to the iconic livery that race car wore all those years ago. 
no extra power has been added for the gt, with audi opting to focus on a little bit weight saving instead. with a reduction of 15 kilograms, the rs6 gt will accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 3.3 seconds, one tenth quicker than the rs6 avant.
