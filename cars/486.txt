following hot on the heels of it’s sibling the boxster gts, is the 2018 porsche 718 cayman gts. the cayman features all the same mechanical specifications as the boxster, with the chief difference being the fixed hard top roof providing slightly more rigidity to the chassis. as mid engined sports cars go, the porsche cayman has cemented itself as one of the most capable cars in the world. now the new gts version should further increase that advantage with more power, torque and a meaner look.
visual highlights include black tinted lights front and rear, a black rear apron, black logos and black tailpipes for the standard-fit sports exhaust. the big 20 inch wheels are finished in a satin black and the logos at the bottom of the doors keep the theme being black as well.
