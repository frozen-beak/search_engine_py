the arrival of the new bmw m4 convertible sees bmw m gmbh making another alluring addition to its legendary high-performance sports car line-up. the new m4 convertible replicates the performance figures of the new bmw m3 sedan and the new bmw m4 coupe, but emphasises its stylish and distinctive appearance through its individual character and places the fascination of sporty and dynamic open-top driving at centre stage. the new model finds bmw m gmbh drawing inspiration from a long tradition: bmw’s high-performance sports car for track and road is entering its fifth generation in open-top form with this new chapter in its history headed “m4 convertible”.
the bmw m4 convertible shares the elegant lines of its open-top 4 series siblings. its design language allows it to skilfully blend a distinctive and graceful silhouette boasting finely balanced proportions when the roof is open with an exceptionally dynamic coupe line, shorn off b-pillars, with the hardtop closed. at the same time, the m4 convertible’s styling cues – including a signature power dome for the bonnet, eye-catching exterior mirrors in twinstalk style and flared front and rear wheel arches bulging over forged lightalloy wheels with mixed tyres in 18-inch (optional 19-inch) format – all identify it clearly as a member of the bmw m3/m4 model family.
