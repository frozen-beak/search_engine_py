the vision tokyo is the latest trailblazing spatial experience to come from mercedes-benz: its monolithic structure, futuristic design idiom and unique lounge ambience in the interior define it as luxurious, young and progressive – thus making it a fitting tribute to the sophisticated megacity and trendsetting metropolis that is tokyo. spatially efficient, versatile and intelligently connected, the vision tokyo – which is also capable of driving autonomously – is an urban transformer that reflects the growing youthfulness of the mercedes-benz brand. at the same time, this innovative five-seater continues a tradition of visionary design-study showcars that has included the vision ener-g-force (los angeles, november 2012), amg vision gran turismo (sunnyvale, 2013) and g-code (beijing, november 2014).
