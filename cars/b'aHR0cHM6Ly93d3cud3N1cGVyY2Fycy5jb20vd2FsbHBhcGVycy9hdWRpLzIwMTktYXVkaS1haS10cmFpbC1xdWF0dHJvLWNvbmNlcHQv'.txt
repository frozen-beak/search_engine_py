audi has shown off their vision of a future automated off-roader, their fourth in a series of electric concepts released since 2017. the ai:trail is intended for exploring, designed for people with active lifestyles who enjoy the outdoors and traversing rough terrain.
this is how marc lichte, audi’s head of design, describes the use case: “with the ai:trail, we are showing an off-road concept with an emissions-free electric drive for an innovative driving experience away from paved roads. consistent with this, we designed a monolithic basic vehicle body with maximum glazing to create an intense connection to the surroundings. a concept for sustainable mobility on demand.”
designed with a big glasshouse, the ai:trail features unobstructed views for great visibility and a high ride height to help clear rocks and water hazards. audi have stated that the target range for easy off-road driving is between 248 to 310 miles, and on tough ground where energy consumption is higher due to elevated wheel slip, the target is 155 miles.
