a modern-day interpretation of the 1954 porsche 550 spyder, the vision spyder concept sadly never made it to production. called the “little rebel” in a nod to james dean’s 550 spyder which he called the “little bastard”, this is a showcase of porsche design circa 2019 in a small roadster form.
the vision spyder concept is part of several concept cars porsche have revealed to the public in november 2020, lifting the lid on a secretive part of the automotive world where designers set out to explore ideas that ultimately are kept behind closed doors.
