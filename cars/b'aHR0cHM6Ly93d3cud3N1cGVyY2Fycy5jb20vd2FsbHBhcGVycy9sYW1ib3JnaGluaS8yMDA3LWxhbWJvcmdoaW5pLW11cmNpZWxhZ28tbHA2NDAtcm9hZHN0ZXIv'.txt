in their re-interpretation of the roadster, the designers of the lamborghini centro stile have remained true to the original style principles of purism, sportiness and functionality. as with the coupé it has now assumed a more aggressive appearance, a substantial influence being the new front and rear bumpers. on the latter there is a new rear diffuser, in which the exhaust system is integrated within a tailpipe. the rear lights are also new, increasing the distinguishing features and making the murciélago roadster as unmistakable at night as in daylight.
as with the coupé the new 6.5 litre (6.496 cm3) 60° v-engine and 640 ps (471 kw) at 8,000 rpm is now used also in the lamborghini murciélago roadster. at 6,000 rpm the 12-cylinder engine reaches the maximum torque of 660 nm. naturally the lamborghini murciélago meets all the current valid european and north american emission standards.
in order to meet the increased thermal requirements of the engine, the engineers built a larger oil cooler. on the exterior this is illustrated by a larger air inlet on the left wing of the vehicle. the liquid cooler on the other hand remains unchanged with the lamborghini vasc system (variable geometry air inlet system). additional electronically controlled air scoops open according to the outside temperature and cool air requirement. this guarantees maximum aerodynamic efficiency.
