the lamborghini diablo vt 6.0 represented a facelift for the model, with lamborghini utilising their knowledge in composite materials by producing most of the body panels in carbon fibre. the front bumper, headlights, rear fenders, wheels and the interior were all redesigned to give the diablo a fresh new look before the model was replaced by the murcielago.
the 6.0 received a wider front and rear track with revised suspension including new electronically controlled dampers and a more rigid chassis. the result was a better handling car that had much improved dynamics and comfort. the engine was enlarged to 6.0l which resulted in a 20% power increase over the old 5.7l unit.
