the bmw x6 m competition is coming in 2020 with 616 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, ready to take on all the other performance suv’s like the lamborghini urus and maserati levante.
performance is very strong from the boosted v8 engine, with 0-62 mph all over in 3.8 seconds and 0-124 mph taking only 13.2 seconds. top speed is limited to 155 mph but can be raised to 180 mph with the addition of the m driver’s package.
as expected the all-wheel drive setup remains, which is sent power through an eight-speed zf automatic transmission which has three selectable modes via two red steering wheel-mounted buttons. the rear end features a multi-clutch centre differential with active locking which will send power to specific rear wheels as needed.
