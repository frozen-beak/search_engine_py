there need be no contradiction between high driving dynamics and low fuel consumption. this is proved by the new mercedes-amg slc43: thanks to the combination of 3.0-litre v6 biturbo engine and 9g-tronic sports transmission, the 270 kw / 367 hp roadster consumes just 7.8 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres. consequently, the open-top two-seater not only uses 0.6 l/100 km less than its predecessor, the slk  55 with v8 naturally aspirated engine, but is also the most efficient six-cylinder performance roadster on the market. the specially developed suspension and model-specific mountings for engine and rear-axle gear unit are designed for high lateral acceleration and low roll. even greater driving dynamics is optionally available with the amg ride control suspension with adaptive adjustable damping and the handling package with mechanical limited-slip differential on the rear axle.
the new slc43 represents the entry point into the current roadster world of amg. apart from the renaming of the slk to slc, the open-top two-seater  also comes with a new amg nomenclature. the familiar two-digit combination typical of amg underscores the slc’s unmistakable membership of the amg family. due to its overall “engineered in affalterbach” package of typical amg driving dynamics, engine response and high efficiency, the slc43 is very competitively positioned in the segment. the 43 stands for the further-developed amg 3.0-litre v6 biturbo engine. the mercedes-amg slc43 is therefore the first v6 model from affalterbach to feature the new nomenclature. this will be successively introduced to the future model portfolio.
