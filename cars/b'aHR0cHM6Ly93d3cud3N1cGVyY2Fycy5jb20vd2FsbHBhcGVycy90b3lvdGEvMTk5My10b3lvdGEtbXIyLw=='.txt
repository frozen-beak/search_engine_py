the mr2 went through a redesign in 1989 (though north america did not receive them until late 1990 as 1991 models). the new car was larger, weighed 350 to 400 pounds (160 to 180 kg) more than its predecessor and received more rounded, streamlined styling.
differences between the normally aspirated and turbocharged models include the “turbo” emblem (us) on the rear trunk, ‘twin cam 16 turbo’ decal above the side intake (japanese market), a fiberglass engine lid with raised vents, fog lights, and an added interior center storage compartment located between the two seats. all sw20 mr2s came with a staggered wheel setup, with wider wheels and tires in the rear than in the front.
the us market mr2 turbo model was able to accelerate from 0–60 in 6.1 seconds and finish the 1/4 mile in 14.7 seconds. a japanese market 1995 rev3 gt turbo was timed by best motoring at 14.227 seconds in the 1/4 mile.
