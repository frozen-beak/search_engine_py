the porsche cayenne turbo gt has been unveiled as the flagship suv in the porsche line-up with no hybrid or electric assistance to be seen. the only body style available for the turbo gt is the coupe, which features a steeper rake at the back of the roof line to give it a sleeker, sportier look. the front bumper design has been altered to help differentiate the turbo gt from the regular turbo coupe, as it has bigger openings and a new lower spoiler profile. 
a 4.0l twin turbocharged v8 engine straight from the panamera turbo s has been employed here to deliver 631 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. porsche havenâ€™t just left it at that though, with the engine undergoing some tweaks to the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons. these changes have been coupled with an ecu upgrade that all up increases power by 10 hp and torque by 22 lb-ft over the unit in the panamera.
