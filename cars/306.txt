audi’s new s7 sportback loses the twin turbo v8 in favour of a single turbo v6 diesel with a 48-volt hybrid system helping to boost performance. that hybrid system is essentially an electric powered compressor, which helps improve acceleration complimenting the mechanical turbocharger. power is rated at 349 ps (257 kw) which is reasonable but lower than the 450 ps (331 kw) output of the outgoing v8. the big improvement however come in the form of lots of torque. peak torque is now rated at a massive 516 lb-ft (700 nm) between 2,500 to 3,100 rpm. the only gearbox options is an eight-speed tiptronic automatic, which operates in tandem with quattro permanent all-wheel drive.
