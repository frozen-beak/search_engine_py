first released as the full blooded gt63 version, the mercedes-amg gt 4-door now has a slightly more sedate entry level model called the gt43. gone is the twin turbo v8, which has been replaced with a 3.0l turbocharged inline 6 that develops 367 ps (270 kw) and 368 lb-ft (500 nm) of torque. the gt43 makes use of mercedes rear-biased 4matic+ all-wheel drive system, and amg’s speedshift 9-speed transmission with torque converter.
despite slotting in at the entry level of the mercedes gt range, the gt43 still gets some of the cool tech included. the 48-volt electric system comes standard and uses mercedes eq boost technology to temporarily deliver an extra 22 ps (16 kw), and a hefty 184 lb-ft (250 nm) more torque when required. the turbocharger on the inline 6 engine also taps into the 48-volt electric system, which is used to spin up the turbos compressor and help reduce or eliminate any turbo lag. mercedes is claiming acceleration of 0-100 kph of just under 5 seconds at 4.9 seconds, with a top speed of 168 mph (270 kph).
