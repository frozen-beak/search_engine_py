the two most powerful and fastest mid-engine sports models from porsche are ready and raring to go: with uprated engines and excellent pasm chassis the boxster gts and cayman gts set new benchmarks for sportiness in their segment. at porsche “gts” stands for gran turismo sport and has promised outstanding porsche performance ever since the legendary 904 carrera gts dating back to 1963. with the new two-seaters porsche is renewing its commitment to authentic sports cars for both the racetrack and everyday use.
the six-cylinder boxer engines fitted in the new top models are based on the 3.4-litre engines from the boxster s and cayman s respectively. thanks to optimised fine tuning they now deliver an additional 15 hp (11 kw). this means that the boxster gts now has an output of 330 hp (243 kw), whilst the cayman gts delivers 340 hp (250 kw). the torque has also increased by ten newton metres in each model. what’s more, the sport chrono package is a standard feature in both mid-engine sports cars. this means that in conjunction with the optional doppelkupplungsgetriebe (pdk) and the active sport plus button, the boxster gts sprints from 0-100 km/h in 4.7 seconds, whilst the cayman gts is even a tenth of a second faster. both vehicles therefore set new reference values.
