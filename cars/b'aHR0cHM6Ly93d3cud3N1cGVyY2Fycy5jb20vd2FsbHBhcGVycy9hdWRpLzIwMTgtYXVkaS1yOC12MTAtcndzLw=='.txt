audi is now offering a new v10 r8 model with rear wheel drive, instead of the usual all-wheel drive, further diversifying the brands line-up. the removal of the all-wheel drive running gear has produced a weight saving of up to 50 kg, further cementing the cars performance capabilities. the r8 rws will be a limited edition run, with 999 units produced globally. each car made will feature a dashboard emblem “1 of 999,” indicating the limited number of units.
“the r8 v10 rws is made for purists,” said stephan winkelmann, ceo of audi sport gmbh. “a limited-edition special model for customers with an appreciation for essential driving enjoyment, the r8 v10 rws is an absolutely exclusive offer. with its mid-mounted v10 engine and rear-wheel drive, it successfully brings the driving concept of our r8 lms racing car to the streets.”
