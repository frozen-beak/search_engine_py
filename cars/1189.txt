for the opening of the new product engineering centre in beijing, mercedes-benz put the focus squarely on the g-code vehicle study. the innovative and versatile sports utility coupé (suc) for town and country shows how emotionally appealing a future compact suc can be, and what evolutionary possibilities the mercedes-benz design philosophy offers. the new product engineering centre of the brand bearing the three-pointed star also features a complete design studio. under the leadership of the main studio in sindelfingen, the studio in beijing creates design models and mobility concepts that incorporate and focus on local cultures and trends.
the g-code concept vehicle is a prime example of this strategy: it interprets the current design idiom of sensual purity from the perspective of the mercedes-benz advanced designers in beijing and sindelfingen. the combination of emotion and intelligence conveys modern luxury in a compact form. as a result, the g-code is also a perfect fit for today’s understanding of design in china.
