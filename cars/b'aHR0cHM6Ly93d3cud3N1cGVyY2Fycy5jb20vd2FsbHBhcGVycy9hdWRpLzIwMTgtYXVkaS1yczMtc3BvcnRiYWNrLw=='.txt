featuring the most powerful 5 cylinder engine in the world and sharper styling, the rs3 sportback will be unveiled at the 2017 geneva international motor show.
as always the rs3 uses the quattro all-wheel drive setup that sends more torque to the rear wheels the faster and harder it is driven. an s tronic seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is available along with adaptive damper control, sport suspension and adjustable exhaust flaps.
“the audi rs3 sportback offers our customers an attractive introduction to the rs world,” said stephan winkelmann, ceo of audi sport gmbh. “since 2011 the sporty compact model has proved itself extremely successful on the market. and with the new five-cylinder engine, the audi rs3 sportback is at the head of its class and continuing that strong track record.”
