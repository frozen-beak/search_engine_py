amg is celebrating their 55th birthday with a track-day special that is its most powerful customer car yet. the mercedes-amg gt track series is an evolution of the black series that is designed as a 724 horsepower track weapon that is not suitable for road use.
thanks to the addition of some motorsport tech in the form of injectors and a tune, the 4.0l twin turbo v8 now produces 37 lb-ft more torque and 4 more hp than the black series. a sequential hewland hls 6-speed racing transaxle sits in the back which is adjustable along with four-way bilstein dampers and a 12-mode racing traction control and abs setup.
