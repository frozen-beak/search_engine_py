squadra corse the racing arm of lamborghini have produced a special one-off track car for the road called the lamborghini sc18 alston. this is the first road car ever made by squadra corse who usually focus on developing the race car versions of regular lamborghini supercars. lamborghini says this may be the firs step in using the motorsport division to sell bespoke creations that compete with the likes of the ferrari monza.
based off the chassis and powertrain of the lamborghini aventador svj, the sc18 features a 770 ps (566 kw) naturally aspirated 6.5l v12 that is good for a peak torque output of 531 lb-ft (720 nm) at 6,750 rpm. that should propel the sc18 from 0-100 kph in a time of 2.8 seconds and onwards to a top speed of over 340 kph. the aero elements that protrude from the bodywork are inspired by the development done with the huracan gt3 and huracan super trofeo evo. the package is very aggressive with red coloured accents scattered everywhere to highlight the splitters, vents and dive planes. the sc18 uses styling cues form the aventador, huracan and centenario, creating a very busy design that would look right at home in a tuners catalog.
the lamborghini sc18 has only been produced as a single copy, with the owner and price unknown. with squadra corse capable of cranking out cars like this, the future of lamborghinis motorsport division is very bright indeed.
