bmw have introduced the x7, their new top of the line luxury suv that sits above the x5 and features a bold aesthetic for the brand. the front is dominated by the largest kidney grille to ever appear on a production bmw, highlighted with chrome along the leading edge each fin. the chrome accents continue around the side windows, lower front bumper air dam, side sills and between the rear tail lights. keeping with the large scale of the design, bmw have made a set of 22-inch wheels available as an optional extra to upgrade the standard 20-inch wheels.
