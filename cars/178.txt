a speedy sports car with four seats and five doors – audi is presenting the tt sportback concept at the paris motor show. the exterior of the show car invokes the design idiom of the classic tt, developing it into a new, elongated sculpture. it is driven by a high-powered 2.0 tfsi engine that delivers 294 kw / 400 hp.
“with the tt, audi created one of the automotive design icons of the last 20 years,” says prof. dr. ulrich hackenberg, audi board member for technical development. “in the years since, we have designed our sporty and elegant five-door audi a5 sportback and audi a7 sportback. in our audi tt sportback concept show car, we are now fusing both concepts to form a new member of a potential tt family.”
the audi tt sportback concept captivates with the power of 294 kw / 400 hp) that flows through a seven-speed s tronic to the quattro permanent all-wheel drive. the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) takes just 3.9 seconds. the sophisticated suspension and the low center of gravity ensure dynamic handling, and the body integrates a number of lightweight aluminum components. a laser spot that complements the led high beam is featured in each of the headlights – this innovation from audi significantly boosts safety when driving in the dark.
