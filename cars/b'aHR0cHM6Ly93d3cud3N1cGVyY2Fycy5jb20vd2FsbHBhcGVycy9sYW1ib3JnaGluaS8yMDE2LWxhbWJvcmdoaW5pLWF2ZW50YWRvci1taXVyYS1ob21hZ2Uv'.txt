automobili lamborghini presented the aventador miura homage, a special edition of the current aventador coupe that pays tribute to the miura, the forerunner of all v12 lamborghini super sports cars in its 50th anniversary year. just 50 units of the car will be produced, the majority of which have already been sold, available in selected markets worldwide.
created by lamborghini’s ad personam studio, the aventador miura homage reflects the colors and specifications of original miura models. the upper body in one color is complemented by the lower body and sill in a contrasting tone. the original miura was produced in a plethora of color and trims, often to the particular specification of a client, with six of the most iconic solid and metallic colorways selected for the aventador miura homage including rosso arancio miura (solid color); verde scandal (solid); and blu tahiti (metallic).
the aventador exterior’s homage to the miura continues with 20″/21″ dione rims in either matt silver or gold. a metallic miura badge on the side and black lamborghini logo on the rear, together with a limited edition plate positioned inside the car clearly denominates the aventador miura homage.
