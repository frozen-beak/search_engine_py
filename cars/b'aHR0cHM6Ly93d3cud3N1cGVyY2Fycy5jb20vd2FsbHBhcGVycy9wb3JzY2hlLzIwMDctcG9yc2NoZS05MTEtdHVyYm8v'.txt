the sixth generation of the range-topping porsche 911 turbo provides towering performance in a practical, stylish and functional package suitable for everyday use. power comes from a revolutionary, 480-horsepower, twinturbocharged, 3.6-liter boxer engine featuring porsche’s first application of variable turbine geometry (vtg). the porsche 911 turbo also offers a redesigned, electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system, and evolutionary styling.
for the first time, the power unit of the porsche 911 turbo features an exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (vtg). the result is yet another increase in engine output, despite engine capacity remaining unchanged at 3.6 liters, up from 420 horsepower to 480 horsepower. maximum torque, in turn, is up from 415 lb-ft to 460 lb-ft, and meaningful twist is on tap beginning at a low 1,950 rpm.
benefiting from a newly developed all-wheel-drive management system, the porsche 911 turbo is able to convert the enormous power of the engine into practical performance on the road with optimum traction in all conditions. the standard porsche traction management (ptm) system features an electromagnetically controlled multiple-plate clutch for distribution of power front-to-rear. responding within 100-milliseconds to both driver input and road conditions, ptm is able to immediately transmit more power to the wheels that can use it best whenever required.
