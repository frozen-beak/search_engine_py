mercedes eqt concept previews an electric people mover set for release in 2022. it will be mercedes ninth eq-badged model, and use the new-generation renault kangoo platform underneath. whilst mercedes are yet to reveal the eqt’s specs, the kangoo comes with a 100 hp / 181 lb-ft electric powertrain hooked up to a 44 kwh battery providing 165 miles on the wlpt cycle.
the styling of the eqt concept features another interpretation of mercedes eq front fascia design that sets the tone of smooth lines across the rest of the body. the rear design continues the light bar trend which stretches the width of the car visually connecting the main rear light assemblies. overall the look is rather elegant for a big boxy people mover, which should fit right in with the rest of the mercedes electric line-up in the coming years.
