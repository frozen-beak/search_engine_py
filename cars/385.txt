on this 40th anniversary porsche is now presenting the new generation 911 turbo and turbo s – the technological and dynamic performance peak of the 911 series. new all-wheel drive, active rear axle steering, adaptive aerodynamics, full-led headlights and the up to 560 hp flat six-cylinder engine with bi-turbo charging underscore the role of the new generation 911 turbo as a circuit racing car, everyday car and technology platform. 
playing an equally crucial role are the entirely new chassis in lightweight design with a 100 mm longer wheelbase and larger 20-inch wheels. the pdcc active anti-roll system, which is being offered for the first time in 911 turbo models, increases dynamic performance even more. this system is standard equipment in the porsche 911 turbo s, as is the sport chrono package with dynamic engine mounts and pccb ceramic brakes; all of these features are also available as options in the 911 turbo. the results: the new 911 turbo s shortens the lap time for the north loop of the nürburgring to well under 7:30 minutes – naturally with standard production tyres. the standard sound symposer intensifies the driving experience; it transmits induction sounds of the turbo engine to the passenger compartment via a speaker diaphragm.
