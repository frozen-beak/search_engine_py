audi have recreated a street-legal version of the silver arrow race car that was designed in 1930s but never built. auto union, one of the companies that form the roots of modern-day audi, had a series of race cars known as silver arrows in the 1930’s. they were only ever used for track use, but there were plans for a road-going version which was internally called the type 52 and likely would have been known as the schnellsportwagen when on sale. 
the type 52 was never built, so audi have dusted off the old designs and brought one to life. the original plan was to fit a 4.4l 16-cylinder engine from the type 22 race car that produced 200 hp, 322 lb-ft and was good for 124 mph. today, audi have opted for a version of the 1936 auto union type c’s 6.0l 16-cylinder. this engine is supercharged and good for 500 hp whilst running on a blend of 50% methanol, 40% gasoline and 10% toluene.
