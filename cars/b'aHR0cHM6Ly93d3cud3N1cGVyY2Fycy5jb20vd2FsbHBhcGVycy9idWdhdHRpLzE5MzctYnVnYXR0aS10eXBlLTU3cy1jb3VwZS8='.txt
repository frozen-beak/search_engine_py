the bugatti type 57 and later variants (including the famous atlantic and atalante) was an entirely new design by jean bugatti, son of founder ettore. type 57s were built from 1934 through 1940, with a total of 710 examples produced. most type 57s used a twin-cam 3,257 cc engine based on that of the type 49 but heavily modified by jean bugatti. unlike the chain-drive twin-cam engines of the type 50 and 51, the 57’s engine used gears to transmit power from the crankshaft.
the type 57s/sc is one of the best-known bugatti cars. the “s” stood for “surbaissé” (“lowered”). it included a v-shaped dip at the bottom of the radiator and mesh grilles on either side of the engine compartment. lowering the car was a major undertaking. the rear axle now passed through the rear frame rather than riding under it, and a dry-sump lubrication system was required to fit the engine under the new low hood. the 57s had a nearly-independent suspension in front, though ettore despised that notion. just 43 “surbaissé” cars were built.
