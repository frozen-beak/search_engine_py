at the pebble beach concours d’elegance, this one-of-a-kind automobile finds itself in the best possible company. every year connoisseurs and exponents of coachbuilt classics come together on california’s pacific coastline to gorge on, mull over and be amazed by an array of automotive exotica. indeed, you’d be hard pressed to find a more appropriate venue for the premiere of the bmw zagato roadster.
