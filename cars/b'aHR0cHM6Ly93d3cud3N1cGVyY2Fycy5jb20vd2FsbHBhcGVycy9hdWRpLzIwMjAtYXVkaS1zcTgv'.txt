audi’s flagship suv has been given some performance credentials with the launch of the diesel powered twin turbo v8 sq8. that v8 engine is the same found in the audi sq7, coming over with the same power and torque numbers of 435 ps (320 kw) and 664 lb-ft (900 nm) respectively. this setup also make use of a 48v mild-hybrid system which uses an electrically powered compressor to torque fill at lower rpm until the smaller of the two mechanical turbochargers can build boost. the second and larger turbo kicks in at about 2,200 rpm at which stage the 4.0l v8 has received boost from 3 different compressors.
styling has been given a good sprinkling of the usual audi s elements. the wheels are now 21-inch in size with bigger 22-inch versions on the option list. these large wheels will are there to clear the optional carbon-ceramic brakes. the wheel arches have been flared, the front air dams are bigger and the rear is adorned with 4 tail pipes that are actually real. in the end, the sq8 is a good looking car if you lie the edgy aesthetics. look out for the petrol powered rsq8, which should be next on the list for audi’s top line suv.
