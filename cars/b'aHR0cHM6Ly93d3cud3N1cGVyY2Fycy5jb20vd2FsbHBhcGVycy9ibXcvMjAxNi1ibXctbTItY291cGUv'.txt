in a follow up to 2011’s parts bin special bmw 1-series m coupe, the brand new m2 has finally given us a small m car that looks like an m4, but with less weight and more proper old school m car philosophy. when the 2-series bmw’s were first introduced in the m235i flavour, they were good, but not m car good. 2 years later and the m2 comes along looking the part, and delivering great performance and fun factor out of the box.
the chosen engine is the 3.0l inline 6 with bmw’s twin-scroll turbo technology pushing compressed air into the cylinders. technology borrowed from the m4 include high-precision direct injection, valvetronic, and pistons and crank bearings. peak power is 365 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 343 pound-feet of torque is available from a 1,400 rpm with a good torque spread through the rev range. that all equates to a 45 horsepower and 13-pound-feet improvement over the m235i. transmission options are either a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch automatic, with bmw’s active m differential available for both. the tyres are michelin pilot sports which sit in a wider track and utilise light weight m sport suspension with 15-inch brake rotors and four-piston callipers up front.
the m2 has lapped the nurburgring nordschleife in 7:58 minutes, coming in only six seconds slower than it’s big brother the m4, but faster than both the alfa romeo 4c and previous generation bmw m3. expect the m2 to compete against the like of the mercedes-amg cla45, audi s3 and porsche cayman gt4.
