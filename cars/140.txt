the lamborghini urraco was unveiled at the 970 turin auto show as the brands entry into the 2+2 budget supercar class. the production model would go on sale 2 years later and be available in p200, p250 and p300 guises. 
designed by marcello gandini, the urraco failed to bring the more dramatic design needed to turn heads at the time, with one of itâ€™s main rivals the maserati merak edging it in the looks department.
as the name suggests, the p250 came with a 2.5l v8 engine capable of 220 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque. the p200 was only offered for the local italian market and featured a smaller 2.0l v8 in order to place the car in a cheaper tax bracket for buyers. the cost savings however meant power and torque dropped down to 182 hp and 130 lb-ft.
