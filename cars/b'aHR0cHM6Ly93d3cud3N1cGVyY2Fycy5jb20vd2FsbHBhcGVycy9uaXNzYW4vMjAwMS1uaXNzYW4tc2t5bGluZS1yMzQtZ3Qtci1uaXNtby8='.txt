on 14 january 2005, nismo resurrected the r34 gt-r for one last tour of duty before the introduction of the anticipated next generation gt-r. labeled as the r34 z-tune, the nismo engineers made the car the most powerful road-going gt-r ever created.
using rebuilt r34s with much technology borrowed from the gt500 racing gt-rs and endurance racing gt-rs, the z-tune has a 2.8 l twin turbo instead of the stock 2.6 l engine, racing pistons, connecting rods and camshafts, and an upgraded ecu, giving the z-tune 500 hp (370 kw) and 540 n·m (400 lb·ft) of torque. the car became affectionately known as the “mother of all gt-rs” and is carries a price tag of about us$ 170,000. nismo has stated that this car will be a limited edition, and only 20 will ever be made and sold.
