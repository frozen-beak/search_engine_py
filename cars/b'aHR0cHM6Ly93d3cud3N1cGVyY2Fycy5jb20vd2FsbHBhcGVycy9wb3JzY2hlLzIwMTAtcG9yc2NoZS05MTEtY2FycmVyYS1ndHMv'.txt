with a power output of 408 hp, outstanding vehicle dynamics and emphatically sporty equipment, the new 911 carrera gts ascends to the pinnacle of the carrera model series. 23 hp more than the 911 carrera s enable the new gts – available as coupé and cabriolet – with 3.8-litre engine to close the gap up to the 911 gt3 with 435 hp. this additional sportiness goes hand in hand with the economic advantage: thanks to porsche intelligent performance, the new top sports car consumes no more fuel than the carrera s.
unique within the carrera family, the 911 carrera gts combines the 44 millimetre wider carrera 4 body of the awd models including a wider track with a classic rear-wheel drive. and there are many more details which distinguish appearance and technology of a gts from other carrera models. for instance, the gts runs on 19-inch centre-mount rs spyder wheels, painted in black, with high-gloss finish rim flanges and 305/30 zr 19 tyres on the rear axle.
special attention was paid to charge exchange in the 3.8-litre flat engine delivering 408 hp: in a special resonance intake manifold, six vacuum-controlled tuning flaps switch between power- and torque-optimized geometry whereas in a carrera s power unit there is only one tuning flap. thus, maximum torque of unchanged 420 nm is already available at 4,200 rpm, 200 rpm earlier compared with the carrera s. add to that a sports exhaust system with two dual tailpipes. their outer shells are painted in black and their inner tubes are polished on the outside and nano-coated.
