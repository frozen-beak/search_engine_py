presented during the 2018 super trofeo world final, the lamborghini urus st-x concept is destined for an ambitious single make racing series to begin in 2020 with a mix of track and off-road racing. the urus st-x will be road legal allowing for the “arrive and drive” setup of the race weekends, that will be run at fia licensed circuits.
the weight of the lamborghini urus st-x is 25% lighter than the regular urus, with increased rigidity and torsional stiffness thanks to the roll cage built into the frame. the twin turbocharged v8 remains producing 650 ps (478 kw) and 627 lb-ft (850 nm) of torque. to comply with fia safety standards, lamborghini have optimised the st-x with a fire extinguishing system and ft3 tank.
the exterior of the concept is dominated by the mantis green livery that has some red and white lines placed along the creases of the bodywork that all combine at the bottom of the doors to create the italian flag. part of the hood has been left as exposed carbon fiber and features larger vents to assist in cooling the engine. a fixed rear wing has been added along with side exit exhausts and 21” single-nut aluminum alloy rims fitted with pirelli p zero tires.
