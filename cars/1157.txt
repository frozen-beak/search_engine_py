limited to a run of only 100 units the mercedes clk dtm was a very special version of the car that started life as a normal clk with an economical four cylinder. inspired by the german dtm racing series, mercedes adorned the clk dtm with a big carbon fibre rear wing and very wide wheel fenders. these visual elements certainly promise a sporty car with real race car looks. the flared wheel arches house bigger wheels to help control the big supercharged engine that drives the rear wheels. power output was 582 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, which was a tremendous amount during its day, ensuring the clk dtm was a real beast on the road.
the interior features carbon racing bucket seats, a five-point harness and sparse carbon fibre door panels. in the end the clk dtm is a weird mixture of the usual luxury mercedes goodies with certain elements replaced with hard core racing alternatives. the dtm tries to be an extreme road car, and goes some way to achieving that goal with an amazing engine, but is ultimately held back by being based off a regular economy car. those elements are always present and take away a little of that special sauce this limited edition is all about.
