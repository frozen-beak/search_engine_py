toyota have revealed two hydrogen and battery electric concept cars using the iconic corolla ae86. the bev concept features a 48 hp, 184 lb-ft electric motor borrowed from the tundra hybrid pickup and a 13.6 kwh battery pack from the phev prius. key to this setup is the inclusion of a six-speed manual transmission, allowing manual shifting of gears with a clutch with the electric powertrain.
for the h2 concept, toyota went with the trueno body ae86 and converted the original 1.6l inline 4 engine to run on liquid hydrogen instead of petrol. this involved changing the injection system, fuel lines and engine timing and keeping everything else the same.
