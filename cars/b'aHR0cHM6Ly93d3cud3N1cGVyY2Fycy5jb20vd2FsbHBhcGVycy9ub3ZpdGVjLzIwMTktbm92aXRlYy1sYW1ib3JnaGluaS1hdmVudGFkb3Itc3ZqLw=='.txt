lower, louder and a little bit flashier, this is italian tuner novitec’s take on lamborghini’s top aventador. with power output staying the same, the key focus for any extra performance gains lie in the form of weight reduction. novitec says 19 kilograms (42 pounds) have been taken off, with the lamborghini aventador svj now tipping the scales at 1,525 kg (3,362 lbs) before fluids. this has all been achieved through the new light weight stainless exhaust system, which also helps the big v12 engine breathe a little better as well. 
as is par for the course with novitec builds, the aventador svj has gained a few exterior additions. a new front spoiler lip has been added along with a couple of flaps mounted on the upper section of the front bumper either side of the central lamborghini badge. large centerlock vossen wheels have been chosen to replace the stock units, measuring 20 inches in the front and 21 inches at the rear. these can be selected in up to 72 different colours in either a brushed or polished finish. lastly, the suspension springs have been replaced lowering the car by 35 millimeters (1.37 inches).
