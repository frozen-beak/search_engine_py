bmw motorsport returned to the dtm in 2012 after almost 20 years away, and the results in its comeback year exceeded all expectations. canadian driver bruno spengler won the drivers’ title, bmw team schnitzer finished in top spot in the team standings, and bmw claimed the manufacturers’ honours.
bmw m gmbh is celebrating this success with the unveiling of the bmw m3 dtm champion edition. mimicking the looks of spengler’s racing car, this special-edition model is available exclusively in frozen black metallic, while the carbon flaps and gurney, various dark chrome elements, matt black wheels and sections of the race car’s livery also betray its close links with the triumphant bmw m3 dtm. the theme is continued by the bmw m stripe design over the cfrp roof and boot lid, bmw m logo to the rear of the front wheel arches and decals in the rear side windows.
inside the car, the door sill strips replicate spengler’s helmet design and the carbon-fibre interior trim strip bears the newly crowned champion’s signature and the car’s serial number. the special-edition model also contains various exclusive interior additions, such as the alcantara steering wheel, handbrake lever embroidered with “m power” lettering, and extended black novillo leather trim with features in contrasting palladium silver.
