the porsche boxster s carries a 3.4-liter flat six that develops 295 horsepower and 251 lb.-ft. of torque from 4400 rpm to 6000 rpm. that’s enough to scoot the boxster s from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds when equipped with a manual gearbox and a blistering 5.8 seconds when equipped with the tiptronic s.
