in a flowing transition, mercedes-benz lands the next coupe: the glc coupé concept is a near-production-standard study that carries the successful gle coupé formula over into a more compact segment. the dynamically expressive show car combines typical stylistic features of a coupé with the sensually pure design idiom of coming suv generations. this emotively appealing fusion is further enriched with details that are strong in character. a twin-blade radiator grille, powerdomes on the bonnet and a four-pipe exhaust system form an aesthetic contrast to the harmonious, almost organic main body section. on the other hand, elements from the rugged off-road world, such as enormous 21-inch tyres, front and rear underbody protection, increased ground clearance and side running boards, are indicative of the off-road performance potential of the glc coupé concept.
