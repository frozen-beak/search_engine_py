never before in the history of the porsche boxster has a change of generation been so comprehensive. the open-top two-seat car receives an entirely new lightweight body and a completely revamped chassis. the new boxster weighs less than the previous generation and rides on a longer wheelbase and a wider track. these new dimensions are coupled with larger wheels and a new electromechanical power steering system to significantly enhance the mid-engine sports car’s driving dynamics. the new boxster boasts superior performance and is also up to 15 percent more fuel-efficient than previous models on the european cycle.
the new boxster benefits not only from an increased wheelbase but also shorter overhangs, while the windscreen has been shifted forward. the passengers are enclosed by the completely redesigned, fully electric top, which now dispenses with a convertible top compartment lid. the interior concept offers the occupants more space and reflects the new porsche outline with a raked center console, which, originating with the carrera gt ensures improved ergonomics in all models.
