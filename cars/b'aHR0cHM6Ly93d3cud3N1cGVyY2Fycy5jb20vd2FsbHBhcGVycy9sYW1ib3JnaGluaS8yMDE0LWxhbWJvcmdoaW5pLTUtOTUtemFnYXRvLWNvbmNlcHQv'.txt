this project is based on an official collaboration between automobili lamborghini and zagato, with the purpose of creating a real contemporary collectible car.
in 1965 marquis gerino gerini was the promoter of the first zagato-bodied lamborghini, the 3500 gtz, a “fuoriserie” based on the 350 gt mechanics. nearly 50 years later albert spiess, one of the most significant lamborghini worldwide collectors, gave zagato the chance to dress the most successful model of all time in the bull’s company history, in order to create a modern collectible car: the lamborghini 5-95.
the milanese atelier transformed the model that revolutionized lamborghini’s history into a contemporary collectible. the lamborghini 5-95 zagato is based on the gallardo lp570-4, the best seller in the first 50 years of sant’agata’s company (1963-2013).
zagato maintained all the technical constraints of the original project but has re-interpreted them according to its philosophy oriented towards functionalism and rationalism – typical values of the milanese school.
the zagato body expresses the typical key values of an “instant classic”: fascinating, rare and a pure expression of the brands it stands for. the 5-95 was created with the only limitation of active and passive safety witch are the value of the donor car.
