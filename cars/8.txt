open air driving has now come to the lamborghini aventador s, with the roadster model debuting at the 2017 iaa frankfurt motor show. weighing only 25kgs more than the coupe model, the roadster still boasts impressive performance figures of 3.0 seconds flat for the 0-100 kph sprint, and a top speed of 350 kph. with their competitors opting for v8’s, turbos and hybrids, lamborghini continues to retain the glorious naturally aspirated v12 that was developed as an all new engine when the aventador was first released. this makes the aventador s roadster the only super sports car with an open top configuration to feature a mid-mounted v12 that sits behind the driver.
the roadster looks very similar to its coupe sibling, with only the rear engine cover marking it as different. this engine cover uses a blade design the stretches from the back window to the rear providing an interesting look. the roof sections are obviously removable, though in traditional lamborghini style, the process in entirely manual with no folding roof mechanism to be seen. these panels weight only 6 kg each and are finished in matte black carbon fiber.
“the new aventador s roadster sets new benchmarks in technology and performance on both road and track, with the roadster version adding a new dimension in driving enjoyment,” says chairman and chief executive officer, stefano domenicali. “the aventador s roadster offers the thrill of open air driving without compromising on driving dynamics or the occupants’ comfort, and adds a further luxurious dimension through the personalization options available.”
