the new cayenne gts announces its outstanding sporting character in its very name. the letters gts go back to the famous 904 carrera gts of 1963. in 2007, the cayenne gts became the first porsche of the modern era to revive the acronym. since then gts has stood at porsche for especially sporty models.
porsche drivers like their car to be sporty – regardless of whether it has two doors or four. at eleven percent, the gts version of the cayenne makes up a high proportion of the model mix of what is currently porsche’s most successful range, with the four-door sports cars in general long since making a major contribution to the company’s profitable growth. at the same time they ensure future investment in the broad spectrum of highly dynamic models offered across the entire portfolio.
it is not only the name of the cayenne gts that is resonant. the 3.6-litre v6 bi-turbo engine is the performance-oriented enhancement of the new power unit presented in the cayenne s. its consumption is lower and it delivers improved levels of performance. compared to the previous model with a v8 naturally aspirated engine, power output rises by 20 hp to 440 hp and torque by 85 nm to 600 nm. the cayenne gts accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.2 seconds, or just 5.1 seconds with the optional sport chrono package. that’s 0.5 and 0.6 seconds respectively less than the previous model. top speed is 262 km/h. as standard it has a sports exhaust system, which provides the familiarly meaty gts sound.
