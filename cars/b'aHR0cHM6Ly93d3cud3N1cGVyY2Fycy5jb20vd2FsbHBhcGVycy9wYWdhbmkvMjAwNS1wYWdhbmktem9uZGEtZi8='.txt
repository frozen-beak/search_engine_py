juan manuel fangio was much more than a great champion. his accuracy, his uprightness, and his human and technical sensibility were among his qualities, typical of the old-time men, they have been for me, an example and an inspiration source. very often, i ask myself how something so material, like a drawing or a technical choice, can express and convey the philosophy of such a men. the name of “el coche”, the way he used to call the car, should have been fangio f1. 
he followed the project with a strong enthusiasm, according to his ideas the f1 had to be innovative, safe and had to be powered by a mercedes-benz engine. he then passed away and as a sign of respect i did not dare to call the car fangio f1 and i decided to name it zonda, “el viento de los andes”. today, after years spent in a rigorous search for perfection, the result is the zonda f, a car that i wish to dedicate to juan manuel fangio, the man who has made everything different.
