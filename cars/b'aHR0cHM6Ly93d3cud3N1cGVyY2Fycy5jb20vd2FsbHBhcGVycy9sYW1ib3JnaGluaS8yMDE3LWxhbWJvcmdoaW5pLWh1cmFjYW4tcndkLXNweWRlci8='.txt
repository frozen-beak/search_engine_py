the huracan spyder launched with all-wheel drive like it’s coupe cousin and most modern lamborghini’s since audi took over the brand. now the huracan spyder gets a rear-wheel drive version complete with newly designed front and rear bodywork with a dynamic more aggressive look distinguishing it from the four-wheel drive version.
the naturally aspirated 5.2l v10 engine produces 580 ps (426 kw), which is down 30 ps (22 kw) from the 610 ps (448 kw) all-wheel drive huracan lp610-4 spyder. peak torque is also reduced down from 413 lb-ft (560 nm) to 398 lb-ft (540 nm). on the positive side, weight has been reduced due to the removal of the heavy all-wheel drive running gear. with a dry weight of just 1,509 kg, the huracan spyder rwd makes do with a weight-to-power ratio of 2.6 kg/hp. acceleration from 0-62 mph is achieved in 3.6 seconds, 0-124 mph goes by in 10.4 seconds with a top speed of 319 km/h (198 mph).
with a revised 40:60 front to rear weight distribution, lamborghini have fitted optimised springs and anti-roll bars, recalibrated the stability and traction controls, and altered the steering setup to deal with the different setup of the rear-wheel drive huracan.
