the 2015 rs5 coupe sport edition features distinctive and sporty design elements on the interior and exterior. the vehicle’s already compelling rs-specific performance design is accentuated with 20-inch 5-v-spoke design wheels and red brake calipers, and is available in daytona gray pearl effect, nardo gray and multiple audi exclusive paint colors (optional) that are complemented by crimson red fine nappa leather interior accents.
the audi rs5 features a high-revving 4.2-liter v8 and a seven-speed s tronic transmission with launch control program. the 4.2 liter, naturally aspirated fsi engine delivers 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque to propel the rs5 from 0 to 60 in just 4.5 seconds and an electronically-governed top speed of 174 mph.
the 7-speed s tronic transmission helps ensure rapid and sure shifts while the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system provides exceptional grip and features a crown-gear center differential to send power to the front and rear axle. the crown-gear center differential operates in conjunction with electronic torque vectoring as a perfect complement to the quattro drivetrain. the sport-tuned suspension renders the body 0.8 inches lower than that of the audi a5.
