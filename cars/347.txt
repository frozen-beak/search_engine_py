the porsche 911 gt2 has returned after a long absence since the introduction of the previous generation model in 2011, now boasting more power & torque, faster acceleration & top speed. the engine builds upon the 3.8l turbocharged flat 6 from the 911 turbo s bumping power from 580 hp to 700 hp through the use of larger turbochargers for an increased volume of charged air being pushed in the cylinders. the cooling system has been improved making sure the gt2 rs stays cool under extreme pressure and heat. in order to help maintain peak power outputs, porsche has fitted a water spray system to the intercooler, helping to strip heat from the charged air going in to the engine. the transmission is a seven-speed double-clutch pdk unit, with no manual option available for the foreseeable future.
track performance should be more than adequate, with porsche opting for a racing chassis setup and ultra high performance tyres at 265/35 zr 20 at the front and 325/30 zr 21 at the rear. ceramic composite brakes come as standard, allowing continued punishment on the track without fade. for those who want even more speed porsche have the optional weissach package that strips 30 kilograms from the cars weight. this is achieved through the use of elements made from carbon-fibre reinforced plastic and titanium. the roof, anti-roll bar and coupling rods on both axles get the carbon-fibre treatment with magnesium wheels reducing both the gross weight and the unsprung weight. customers who purchase the gt2 rs will have access to a special edition porsche chronograph that is only available to those with the new gt2.
