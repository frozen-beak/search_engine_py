the all new audi s3 is here in sportback and sedan body styles, keeping the familiar formula of a turbocharged 4 cylinder, haldex all-wheel drive and dual-clutch transmission. the styling has been updated for this generation, keeping it in line with audi’s current design language which is very similar to what came previously, just with a different twist. unlike before, the 3-door hatchback and cabriolet versions will not be appearing in the s3 line-up, following their removal from the regular a3 series.
using a heavily revised version of the mqb platform, the 2021 s3 develops 310 ps (228 kw) of power and 295 lb-ft (400 nm) of torque from the ea888 2.0l inline four engine. the haldex-style all-wheel drive system remains for this generation, utilising a centrally-mounted clutch pack before the rear axel for power distribution front-to-rear. performance is around the level expected for a car the sits in the middle of the base models and the proper hot rs versions. acceleration from 0-62 mph will take around 4.8 seconds, which is around the same mark as it’s german rivals in the mercedes-amg a35 and bmw m135i. top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph.
