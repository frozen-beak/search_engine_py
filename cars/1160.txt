the 2017 la auto show has seen the unveiling of mercedes third generation cls, featuring an all new inline 6 engine with eq boost providing short bursts of extra power. the new eq boost system provides and extra 16 kw/22 hp and a further 250 nm of torque over short periods. the system is also capable of allowing the engine to run in ‘sailing’ mode which charges the batteries via energy recuperation.

“the new cls is a design icon as the archetype of the four-door coupé. in line with our design philosophy of sensual purity, we have reduced its dna in an extremely puristic way and at the same time emotionally charged it with elegant beauty”, says gorden wagener, chief design officer daimler ag.
