the gallardo design has now been further accentuated in the new lamborghini gallardo lp560-4. the new front end is characterized by triangular and trapezoidal forms – two shapes that are highly typical of the lamborghini design language. divided by diagonal elements in body color and in black, the overall look of the front end is broader and more forceful, giving it an even stronger bond with the road.
to complete the new look larger air intakes have been created ahead of the front wheels and the new 19-inch “apollo polished” alloy wheels, painted in matt black and featuring precision-machined spokes in polished silver.
also new is the even more dynamic rear end design on the lamborghini gallardo lp560-4. the triangle and trapezoid are, of course, the characteristic design elements here, too. the air outlet for the power unit now has now a wider surface area, which improves its thermodynamic efficiency. a new style package is available as an option and offers high-gloss black paintwork on the underside of the front spoiler, front and rear grilles and the transverse element of the rear trim to give the lamborghini gallardo lp560-4 an even more powerful look.
