the porsche 928 began as a response to the diminishing sales of the 911 at the time, with porsche deciding to design a luxury touring car as the future of the brand. history will show that 911 survived and thrived, whilst the 928 has it’s run and hasn’t been seen since.
the 928 featured a big 4.5l front mounted v8 that was water-cooled and drove the rear wheels, a good combination for any car enthusiast. the weight distribution was a nice 50/50 front/rear split, ensuring a well-balanced car. development saw the innovation of the “weissach axle”, which introduced a rear-wheel steering system that helped stability while braking during a turn.
all these ingredients resulted in porsche winning the 1978 european car of the year with the 928, beating out competitors bmw and their 7-series.
