as part of the 2014 monterey car week, bugatti is celebrating the conclusion of its “les légendes de bugatti” edition (bugatti legends). it honors ettore bugatti, founder and patron of the brand, and is based on the historical model type 41 royale. as with the five previous legends, only three of the final legends model will be produced. it costs €2.35 million net. bugatti is presenting all six bugatti legends together for the first and only time.
ettore bugatti is one of the most important figures of the automotive world in the 20th century. he knew how to combine his family’s rich artistic heritage with his technological ideas and succeeded in creating the foundation for a design language that shaped the brand for years to come and made it unmistakable. the brand’s values of “art, forme, technique” define this unique approach. under his leadership, vehicles were produced that were ahead of their times both technically and stylistically, and are today highly valued collectors’ items. two such vehicles are the type 57 sc atlantic and the unforgettable type 41 royale that ettore bugatti built as the most powerful and luxurious car of its time. it also serves as the historical basis for this bugatti legend. the lightweight construction designs of the 1920s, such as the type 13 “brescia” or the type 35 – which was one of the most successful racing cars in motor sport history with 2,000 victories and podium finishes – are further notable representatives of the brand.
