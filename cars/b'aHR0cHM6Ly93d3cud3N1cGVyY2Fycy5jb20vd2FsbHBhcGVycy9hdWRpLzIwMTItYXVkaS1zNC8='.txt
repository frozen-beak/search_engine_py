a bestseller has become even more attractive: audi has updated the a4 series. new solutions for efficiency, driving dynamics and infotainment, along with an even more attractive design, attest the “vorsprung durch technik” achieved by the a4 sedan, the a4 avant, the a4 allroad quattro and the s4.
the new look further accentuates the horizontal lines at the front end. the engine hood is more arched, the upper corners of the single frame grille are tapered, and the cross ribs and the audi rings are highlighted three-dimensionally. the grille is painted gray, with high-gloss black on the six-cylinder models or in combination with the s line exterior package. the redesigned bumpers are striking with their angular air inlets, their revised grilles and the flat front fog lights. the a4 allroad quattro is distinguished by its grille’s horizontal chrome applications and by the round fog lights.
