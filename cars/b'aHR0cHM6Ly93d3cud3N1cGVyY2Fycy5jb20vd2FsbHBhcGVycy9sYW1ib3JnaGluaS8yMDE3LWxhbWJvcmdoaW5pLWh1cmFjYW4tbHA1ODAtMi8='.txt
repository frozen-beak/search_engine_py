if you looked at the huracan and thought the all-wheel drive was a bit much and you wanted a pure rear-drive edition, lamborghini have you covered. called the huracan lp580-2 denoting 580 ps (426 kw) of power and 2-wheel drive, it should provide an answer to the problem a lot of people seem to have with the original; understeer. whilst not everyone agrees on the severity of push experienced whilst driving the all-wheel drive variant huracan, having a rear-wheel drive mode to choose from is a smart move from lamborghini.
first up is the weight reduction, which equals 33 kilograms in total. not a huge amount, but welcomed since the power output has been reduced by 30 ps. that lower power and lack of all-paw grip off the line means the 0-62 mph acceleration has slipped from a mighty 2.5 seconds down to a more normal 3.4 seconds. still nothing to sneeze at, but far from the same violent push off the line as the original huracan.
to distinguish the two models, lamborghini have fitted a different front bumper design that features a revised shape to the lower air dams. overall it looks a little more muted, and in my opinion, not as good. as least the aero is good according to lamborghini, with the frontal area increasing down pressure on the front axle. the rear lip spoiler and diffuser also work together to improve airflow around the rear of the car, removing the requirement of a movable rear spoiler.
