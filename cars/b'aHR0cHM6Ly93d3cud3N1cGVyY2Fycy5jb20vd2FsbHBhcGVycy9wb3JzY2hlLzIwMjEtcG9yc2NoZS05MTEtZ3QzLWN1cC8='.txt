more power and better aero for the first 992 generation porsche 911 built only for the track. continuing on from the very successful 911 gt3 cup of the last generation 911, porsche have pulled together all their expansive racing experience to make the gt3 cup their best racer yet.
the 4.0l flat 6 engine revs up to 8,400 rpm and has been tweaked to deliver 24 more hp with 503 hp in total and 470 nm of torque at 6,150 rpm. with porsche investing plenty of money into the development of synthetic fuels, the new gt3 cup will have the ability to make use of these new fuels as they come available n the future. a six-speed sequential transmission is tasked with the job of changing gears, which are selected via steering mounted shift paddles.
in a effort to make the 992 generation gt3 cup quicker, easier to handle and more durable, porsche have increased the front and rear tracks with wider fenders to house the increased width. the rear wing is adjustable 11 ways, and polycarbonate windows, carbon fiber-reinforced plastic body panels and an aluminum chassis all combine to keep the dry weight down to 2,777 lbs.
