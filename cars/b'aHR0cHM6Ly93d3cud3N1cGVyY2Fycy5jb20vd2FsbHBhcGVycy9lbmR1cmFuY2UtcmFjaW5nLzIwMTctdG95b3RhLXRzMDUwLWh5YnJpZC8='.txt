toyota gazoo racing will once again compete at le mans 24 hours in a bid to secure a maiden victory after last year’s heartbreaking result. toyota has developed the ts050 to comply with the new 2017 world endurance championship regulations, which means changes in aero elements and ultimately slightly slower lap times for the cars.
the hybrid powertrain has undergone further enhancements to improve efficiency for better reliability. “we know from painful experience that le mans is a very difficult race to win, but that is our target,” said team president toshio sato.
