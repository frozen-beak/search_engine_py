as a technology leader, the new mercedes s-class previews the future of the company’s line-up. available at launch are petrol and diesel 6 cylinder engines in two different outputs, with a v8 and a plug-in hybrid coming sometime in 2021. for those looking for a bigger engine, the long-wheelbase maybach version is set to feature a big v12 engine and amp up the luxury factor even more.
for this seventh generation s-class, mercedes have taken a cautious approach to the styling with an elegant design that should be pleasing to most without taking any risks. on the inside a larger change has taken place with the interior completely re-designed with a large central touchscreen panel taking center stage. the drivers display behind the steering wheel has a three-dimensional image function which actually tracks the drivers eyes to adjust the 3d effect accordingly.
key to the new tech is the inclusion of level 3 autonomous driving functionality, which may not be available at this point, but the new s-class has all the required parts to activate once allowed. in fact the s-class is the first in the industry to include a lidar sensor mounted on the front of the car for precise mapping of it’s surroundings. an autonomous valet parking system and eyes-off motorway autonomous driving system are also included.
