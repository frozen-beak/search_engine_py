for 2018 lamborghini are offering an evolution of their huracan super trofeo race car with an evo spec update, set to increase aero and reduce lap times. the huracan super trofeo evo will be raced in lamborghini’s one-make racing series, and be eligible for various gt series worldwide.
the biggest changes come in the form of the aerodynamic package that reduces drag by 8%, which boosts overall performance for faster lap times. this has been achieved with a new central fin atop the engine cover that extends to the rear spoiler, helping guide the airflow more cleanly. this setup is common in le mans prototype cars and formula 1. the roof air intake is new along with most of the carbon fibre body as only the flat floor, front splitter and rear diffuser are the same as the original 2015 super trofeo. all these improvements have resulted in a lap of monza in 1min 46.3sec, an improvement of 1.5sec over the old car.
