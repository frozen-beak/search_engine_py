the first mercedes was a racing car, its most recent successor carries this heritage forward: with the new mercedes-amg gt, the mercedes-amg sports car brand is moving into a new, top-class sports car segment for the company. the gt is the second sports car developed entirely in-house by mercedes-amg. its front mid-engine concept with transaxle and the intelligent aluminium lightweight construction form the basis for a highly dynamic driving experience. its likewise newly developed amg 4.0-litre v8 biturbo engine underscores the hallmark amg driving performance. the first sports car engine with internally mounted turbochargers (‘hot inside v’) and dry sump lubrication is configured in two output ratings: as a gt with 462 hp and as a gt s with 510 hp. the new gt combines driving dynamics and first-class racetrack performance with superb everyday practicality, and efficiency that sets new standards in the segment.
it has everything you would expect from an authentic mercedes-amg sports car – from the characteristic styling, thoroughbred motorsport technology to the optimum weight distribution. the drive system tailored consistently to driving dynamics perfectly complements this set-up. the centrepiece of the mercedes-amg gt, the new 4.0-litre v8 biturbo, responds instantly with extreme power right from low revs and delivers outstanding performance.
