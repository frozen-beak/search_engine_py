the new bmw m5 competition is an all-wheel-drive v8 super saloon that includes more power, a revised chassis and a sharper look. the 4.4: twin turbocharged v8 engine now makes 625 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 750 nm of torque between 1,800 to 5,800 rpm. this power bump now puts the m5 competition slightly ahead of its mercedes-amg rival the e63 s, which comes with 612 horsepower. the all-wheel-drive setup helps achieve a 0-100 kph sprint of just 3.3 seconds, which is 0.1 seconds faster than the e63 s. for those that like the option on the mercedes to switch into a rear-wheel-drive only mode, bmw has opted to copy the idea and implement it themselves on the m5.
bmw haven’t stopped at adding more power, with the chassis getting tweaked as well. the body sits 7mm lower than before, the min springs are now 10 percent stiffer and the auxiliary springs have been made shorter to help the improve reaction times of the suspension. the engine mounts have been stiffened from a spring rate of 580n/mm to 900n/mm, which helps reduce weight transfer and allows the front axle to react more quickly on turn-in. a new exhaust that is louder when needed and the 20 inch wheels are now lighter and feature a forged y-spoke design.
