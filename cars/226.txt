based on the audi r8 coupe v10 plus and limited to a production run of just 24 units, the ‘selection 24h’ is built to pay homage to the success of the r8 lms with its 323 wins in national and international race assignments since 2009.
the selection 24h package includes dynamic steering, adaptive damper control with magnetic ride and laser lighting. all up the changes are minor making this special edition r8 less appealing than others, a point that is reflected in the low production count.
