toyota’s eagerly awaited, compact 2+2 sports car, the gt86, is an entirely driver-oriented vehicle. it gives form to the pure, intrinsic joy of driving through precise, instantaneous response to even the smallest throttle or steering inputs, for those who regard driving as a passion rather than a necessity.
based on an entirely new platform, the gt86 has a low, highly aerodynamic bodyshell stretched tight over the engineering hard points, making it the world’s most compact four-seat sports car design. 
shunning a heavy, large displacement powertrain for its performance, the gt86 returns to toyota’s sporting roots with the world’s only combination of a compact, front-mounted, naturally aspirated, free-revving, horizontally opposed ‘boxer’ petrol engine and rear-wheel drive.
this unique powertrain format combines with light weight, low inertia and a low centre of gravity to realise the best possible power-to-weight ratio. these attributes give the gt86 lively, accessible performance, highly engaging, readily exploitable dynamic abilities with minimal electronic intrusion, and maximum driving pleasure.
