a performance model of the audi r8 v10 rwd has arrived with more power and a focus on fun driving. the 5.2l v10 engine has gained 29 horsepower and 8 lb-ft of torque over the non performance model, a version that is being replaced for both the rear-wheel drive and quattro r8’s by the performance.
new features include dynamic steering, cfk stabilizers, ceramic disc brakes, bucket seats and subtly revised styling. that styling has a slit under the hood that pays homage to the audi sport quattro from the 80’s. much if these inclusions and updates have been inspired by the r8 gt4, with the suspension tuned for the rear-wheel drive setup with double wishbones and a passive differential lock.
