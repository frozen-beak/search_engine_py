2025 bmw m3 loses the rear-wheel drive and tries to make up for it with a subtle design tweak and a little more power. with the m3 now only available in xdrive spec (all-wheel drive), bmw’s m division have moved further away from the pure driver’s car formula that they once did so well. yes, the xdrive models offer some benefits like better grip in difficult conditions and improved acceleration, but i feel some fans of the m3 will mourn the loss.
