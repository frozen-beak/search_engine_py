arriving in 1995 the r33 gt-r was the successor to the r32, featuring new styling and a focus on improving the r32’s weaknesses. due to japanese car manufacturers facing strict power restriction at the time, the r33 made do with the same power output as before. that meant 280 ps (206 kw) of power and 271 lb-ft (368 nm) of torque. the inline 6 engine remained relatively untouched apart from the turbo dump pipe, turbo compressor housing, intercooler and a larger oil pump drive collar. the gearbox also got stronger syncros.
measuring 4 inches longer and around 1 inch wider, the r33 had a longer wheel base and was designed with aerodynamics in mind. the exterior panels were computer aided in design to allow greater aero efficiency and cooling capabilities. the new skyline also received numerous stiffening and strengthening upgrades to the chassis and suspension, in an effort to enhance the cars handling and response.
all the little improvements saw the r33 gt-r lap the nürburgring 21 seconds faster than the r32 did previously, making the new gen skyline the fastest ever skyline at the time.
