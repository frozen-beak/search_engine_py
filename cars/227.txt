the new r8 v10 plus is audis most powerful production car of all time. the 5.2l, 40-valve engine delivers a maximum power output of 602 hp and peak torque of 560 nm. top speed cracks the famed 200 mph mark cementing this generation r8 as a true supercar worthy to fight with likes of ferrari, lamborghini and porsche.
the chassis consists of a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (cfrp) resulting in a lightweight design, with great rigidity and safety. the underbody utilises a long diffuser which helps to boost downforce, and the suspension is a double wishbone setup.
“with the new audi r8, our engineers are bringing accumulated racing expertise from the race track onto the road. no other model of ours evokes more dynamic emotion. the new r8 v10 plus is therefore the most powerful and fastest series-production audi of all time.” -prof. dr. ulrich hackenberg, board member for technical development at audi.
