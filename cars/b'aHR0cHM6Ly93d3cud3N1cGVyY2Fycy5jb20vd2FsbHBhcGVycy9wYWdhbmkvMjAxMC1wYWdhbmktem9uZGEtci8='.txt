a pagani zonda is never shy of a drive at the racetrack, a fact that was undermined numerous times in the past with records for production vehicles at the nurburgring nordschleife. with the input of its avid track focused customers, the pagani team has created the zonda r using bespoke engineering solutions to meet the performance demands for a trackday version of the highly popular zonda f.
the lucky owners of the zonda r will experience a level of performance on the track, that is simply not possible on the road. a power-to-weight ratio of 701 hp-per-ton will catapult them from 0 to 60 mph in less than 2,7 seconds, the brembo carbon ceramic brakes ensure the car comes to a standstill even quicker.
the zonda r is built in a limited production run and sold at a price of 1,460,000 euro plus taxes, a performance machine, a track toy, a collectors item, a masterpiece signed by horacio pagani.
