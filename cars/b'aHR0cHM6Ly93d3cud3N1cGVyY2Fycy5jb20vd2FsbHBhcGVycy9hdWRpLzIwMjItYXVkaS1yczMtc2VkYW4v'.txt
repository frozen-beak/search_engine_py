audi’s new rs3 sedan has broken cover revealing a more aggressive design and some clever new hardware. returning to power the rs3 is the dq500 5 cylinder engine that now produces up to 394 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. it is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and can now launch from 0-62 mph in 3.8 seconds, a full 0.3 seconds quicker than the previous model.
in order to liven up the handling of the rs3, audi have fitted a torque-vectoring rear differential with the ability to mechanically split power between the two rear wheels. this allows each rear wheel to apply a different amount of torque to aid cornering and improve traction and grip. the front end has also gotten a thorough going over with stiffer lower wishbones, subframes and stabilisers on a wider front track fitted with bespoke pivot bearings.
