the car everybody wants more power from gets the trd special edition treatment, complete with better tires, brakes and suspension but sadly no extra ponies. the 2.0l boxer engine remains the same rated at around the 200 horsepower mark. it seems to be the fate of the current generation toyota 86 and close cousin subaru brz that both companies are determined the cars do not need any extra engine performance.
the bigger brakes are supplied by brembo, the better tires come in michelin pilot sport 4 flavor and the upgraded suspension features sachs dampers. all this should add up to a slightly better handling car, that already was known to be a good handling car. outside the special edition adds some flare with a ‘raven black’ paint job with tricolor trd graphic along the side of the car. this colour will remain as the only choice for all 1,418 units set to be made. the exterior changes are completed with the very subtle trd body kit. the inside is decked out in red stitching, trd logos and a new steering wheel.
