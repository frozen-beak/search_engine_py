the new porsche boxster’s top model in the open two-seater series retains the independent character of the previous spyder, which has already attained cult status. for example, the classic fabric roof is still opened and closed by hand, and the sports car is only available with a manual transmission.
as a true original roadster, the boxster spyder offers a traditional sports-car driving experience but with contemporary performance. this means a firm sports suspension with a 20-mm lower ride height, brakes taken from the 911 carrera, more direct steering, and a 3.8-liter six-cylinder engine with an output of 375 hp (276 kw). drivers and passengers can thus look forward to a genuine sports-car experience with outstanding driving dynamics in the lightest yet most powerful boxster there is. it only takes around 4.5 seconds for the boxster spyder to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h; the model’s top speed is 290 km/h.
the distinctive design of the boxster spyder includes stylistic elements that recall the legendary sports and race cars from porsche. for example, as a tribute to the 718 spyder from the 1960s, the new boxster spyder has two prominent streamlined bulges that extend down along the long rear lid behind the headrests. the partially manually operated, lightweight top is suitable for everyday use and brings to mind roadsters from the past, while the fins that stretch back to the rear lend the vehicle’s silhouette its characteristic design. the front and rear end of the model were taken from the cayman gt4.
