porsche is presenting the second generation of the mid-engined cayman sports coupe, highlighted by the new, flat-six ‘boxer’ engines, providing not only more power, but also significantly greater fuel efficiency. a further improvement of both fuel economy and performance is guaranteed by the porsche doppelkupplungsgetriebe (pdk), the new double-clutch gearbox now available as an option on both the cayman and cayman s.
the 3.4-litre power unit in the cayman s now features direct fuel injection, and delivers 320 bhp (235 kw), up by 25 bhp. these developments see the engines fitted to the cayman and cayman s coupes offering more horsepower than those in the boxster roadster. this move emphasises the sports driving orientation of the cayman and further differentiates the coupe.
an outstanding power-to-weight ratio of 4.2kg/bhp on the cayman s in particular ensures optimum driving dynamics. for example, the cayman s with pdk and launch control (featured in the optional sports chrono package plus) accelerates from 0-62mph (0-100 km/h) in 4.9 seconds, setting the benchmark in the range.
