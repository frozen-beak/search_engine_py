following on from the centenario coupe, lamborghini have shown off the open top roadster version at the 2016 monterey car week in california. also limited to just 20 cars built, the centenario roadster embodies a new design direction for lamborghini with clean surfaces and superb reflections key elements. the paint job is of special note, with a newly developed colour called “argento centenario” providing a special silver exterior finish that sets this supercar apart.

“lamborghini prides itself on the relentless pursuit of experimentation. we are proud to unleash centenario’s further potential in the form of a classic roadster; the perfect harmony between innovation and timeless design. this unique engineering achievement is a befitting tribute to lamborghini’s extraordinary past and a preview of its brilliant future. centenario roadster embraces the cutting edge characteristics of its coupé sibling and embraces the freedom of a true open-top super sports car for a pure drive experience” stefano domenicali, automobili lamborghini chief executive officer, said.
