audi’s activesphere concept blends a coupe style hatch with split opening for a pick-up like rear deck. essentially the roof section at the rear slides back over the top of the roof, and the rear gate swings down to create a large aperture for sliding in a load similar to a conventional pick-up. the main difference being this deck is a lot smaller, but enough to load a few bikes at least.
