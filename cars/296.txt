audi rs6 gto concept car pays homage to the audi 90 quattro gto race car which raced in the us-based imsa series for 1989. that iconic race car has a successful if not short existence, winning 7 out of the 12 races it competed in until the powers that be at audi decided to shelf the project. it featured a fearsome 2.2l 5-cylinder engine with a giant kkk turbocharger bolted on to produce 710 hp whilst sitting in a tubular steel spaceframe and looking like a low, mean racer that could eat up any race track thrown at it.
for 2020, the tremendously fast rs6 family wagon has been tweaked in a project by apprentices at audi’s neckarsulm factory, creating the rs6 gto concept. special treatments include huge white center-locking turbofan wheels with wider wheel arches to house them, a large ear spoiler finished in red, side exit exhausts and of course a red, silver and black livery. also included are bespoke side skirts, front splitter and rear diffuser, full roll-cage with six-point race harness and racing seats.
