mercedes-benz will in future also market its slr mclaren super sports car in the form of a roadster with a top. in common with formula 1 vehicles of today, it, too, will be made of carbon fibre, a material that will endow the vehicle with a very high degree of safety as well as extreme torsional stiffness at the same high level as the coupé version. this gives rise, in combination with the racing-type chassis, to outstanding ride characteristics.
the maximum speed of the new high-performance sports car, which is powered by an amg v8 compressor engine delivering 460 kw/626 hp, is 332 km/h, therefore at the same high level as the coupé. although, thanks to its fully retractable top, the roadster offers undiluted open-air driving pleasure in the highest performance class, its occupants in no way lose out in terms of comfort or the vehicle’s suitability for everyday use. consequently, the new roadster opens up a new dimension in refinement for open-top super sports cars.
like the coupé version, the new mercedes-benz slr mclaren roadster once again unites the legend of the successful slr racing models from the 1950s with the innovative technology of modern formula 1 vehicles from the vodafone-mclaren-mercedes team. typical stylistic elements, such as the arrow-shaped tip of the formula 1 silver arrow, establish a visual link with the racing cars. the slr leg-end of the 50s lives on stylistically in the distinctive lateral louvers, side pipes behind the front wheels and the wide-opening gullwing doors.
