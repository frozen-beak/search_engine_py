with the tt s line competition, audi brings the sporty character of the tt coupé and tt roadster even more to the fore. the special model includes an array of striking details for the exterior and interior – from the fixed rear wing to the audi virtual cockpit with sport screen. the special edition will be available from the end of 2016.
the audi tt has always held the power to fascinate with its sporty design and dynamic handling. this character is now underscored by the s line competition special model. the singleframe, the blade at the front, the exterior mirror housings and the diffuser insert come in a high-gloss black finish, to reinforce its forceful looks. the fixed rear wing of the limited-edition model also radiates sports appeal. this component, too, is painted high-gloss black. the tailpipe trims of the exhaust system have a black chrome finish.
