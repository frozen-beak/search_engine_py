the porsche boxster model line has a new luxurious top model in addition to the sporty boxster spyder: the boxster s black edition limited to 987 cars. with its 320 hp – ten hp more than the boxster s – this edition offers a substantially larger range of standard equipment and exclusive special options, all at a very attractive price. the new mid-engined sports car is black all over: black body, black hood, and black 19 inch boxster spyder wheels accentuate the muscular appearance of the top roadster.
the colour concept of the boxster s black edition is consistent in every detail. the rear side air intake grilles are painted in black as is the twin tailpipe of the exhaust system. the model lettering painted in black on the rear luggage compartment lid identifies the black edition as much as the embossed black edition model designation on the side of the fabric hood. the roll-over bars are painted in black, too.
