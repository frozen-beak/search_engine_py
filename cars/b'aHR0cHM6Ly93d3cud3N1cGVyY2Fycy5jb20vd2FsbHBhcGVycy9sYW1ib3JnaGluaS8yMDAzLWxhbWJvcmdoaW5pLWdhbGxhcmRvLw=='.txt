designed to redefine its segment as the best high performance sports car and driving behaviour that fits its driver in every situation. the gallardo is the synthesis of a true sports car that can be used on an every day basis.
the choices for engine, transmission, space frame and body, suspensions, brakes and electronics are then all in line with such an objective. the result is a compact (length 4.3 m) 2-seater high performance car (maximum speed well over 300 km/h), that can be driven with pleasure both on race tracks and on long distance journeys on country and city roads.
its design, based on an italdesign-giugiaro style proposal was developed by the lamborghini centro stile to incorporate the parameters of our extreme design philosophy. the gallardo dimensions combined with the competitive performance targets ensure the car an athletic compactness. the long wheelbase complemented by short overhangs dynamise its appearance. the cab-forward cockpit integrated in the body by a strongly slanted front screen and tensed pillars, the complex surfacing intersected by crisp graphics and its cooling flow oriented detailing evokes as in the lamborghini tradition in its proportions and formal language a strong aeronautical influence.
