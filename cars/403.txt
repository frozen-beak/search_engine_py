sending off the 991 generation of the 911 with style is the 2019 porsche 911 speedster. sharing the powertrain and underpinnings of the gt3 and rocking some new retro-inspired bodywork, the 911 speedster is a fitting send off to a generation of 911 that has won awards across the board.
development has been undertaken by porsche motorsports and delivers a very focused special edition 911. the high revving naturally aspirated 4.0l flat 6 engine produces a peak power output of 510 ps (375 kw) at a dizzying 8,400 rpm. peak torque of 346 lb-ft (470 nm) is available at 6,250 rpm, with the speedster capable of a 0-62 mph sprint of 4.0 seconds flat and a 193 mph top speed.
instead of fitting a soft-top or hard-top folding roof to the 2-seater open top speedster, porsche provide a tonneau cover instead. this is put in place once the car is stopped to give some protection from the elements. the production run will consist of 1,948 units referencing the year the original porsche 356 was made.
