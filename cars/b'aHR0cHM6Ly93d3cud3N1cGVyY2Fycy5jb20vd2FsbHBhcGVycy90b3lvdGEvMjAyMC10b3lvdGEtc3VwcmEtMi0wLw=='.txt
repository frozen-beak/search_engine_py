with toyota enjoying good success with the release of the new supra, a version with a smaller 2.0l engine has arrived. now buyers will have the choice of either the turbocharged 3.0l inline 6, or the lighter and less powerful turbocharged 2.0l inline 4. the aim of the smaller engine is to widen the market appeal of the supra and lower the entry level cost.
despite being smaller, the 4 cylinder engine still manages to produce strong performance numbers. peak power has been rated at 258 ps (190 kw), which compares fairly well to the 335 ps (246 kw) of the 3.0l. torque is also lower but remains strong with 295 lb-ft (400 nm) instead of 365 lb-ft (495 nm). the 0-62 mph sprint will now take a little longer with a time of 5.2 seconds, whilst the top speed remains limited to 155 mph.
the good news comes in the form of weight reduction. the smaller engine tips the scales 100 kilograms lighter, and reduces the weight over the front axel. toyota are claiming this improves the inertia characteristics and chassis balance of the supra, resulting in even sharper handling.
